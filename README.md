# CS286_Final

This project examines the decrypted zodiac 408 cipher text as
a starting point to solving the zodiac 340 cipher.
A digraph is generated from 1M characters read in from
the Brown corpus. A second digraph is generated from
the plain-text number-mapped text of the decrypted z408 cipher.
The distance between the 2 digraphs are measured and a score
is generated by summing the absolute value of the difference
taken from corresponding indexes of the 2 digraphs.

A variant of Jakobsen's algorithm is used to iterate through
permutations of z408 texts by swapping the columns, then generating
a new digraph, and scoring against the brown digraph. The permutation
with the smallest distance at the end using distance ddescribed above 
fails to achieve the correct column order with an accuracy of 13/26 = 50%

A PCA model will then trained from the vectors of the Brown corpus digraph instead.
The vectors from the z408 digraph will then be used to test against the model.
Additional testing will be done on digraphs generated from column-swapped
permutations of the z408 text. The output vectors of those tests will
then be examined in an attempt to find a solution to the column-swapping
problem for the z408 cipher and, by extension, the z340 cipher.
