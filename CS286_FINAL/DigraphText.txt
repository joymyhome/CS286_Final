the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments merger proposed however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation wards protected the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan  the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ask jail deputies on other matters the jury recommended that  four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail  fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for

snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept  in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken  five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or  the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform sam

superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee davis received  votes in saturdays election and bush got  ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said being at the polls was just like being at church i didnt smell a drop of liquor and we didnt have a bit of trouble the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however it was marked by

abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce  million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of  million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug  he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said you take out of circulation many millions of dollars rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday austin texas

adverse vote of  to  kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april  ballot when texas votes on a us senator rep wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb  the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by twothirds majorities before march  to be printed on the april  ballot roberts said opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice all dallas members voted with roberts except rep bill jones who was absent austin texas  paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of  people when the shouting ended the bill passed  to  sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse the bill would increase from  to  the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway cottens attack the bills defenders were mostly smalltown legislators like j w buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs this is a poor boys bill said chapman dallas

court yesterday the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements  a separate trial bellows made the request while the allwoman jury was out of the courtroom fears prejudicial aspects the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this yes your honor replied bellows what this amounts to if true is that there will be a freeforall fight in this case there is a conflict among the defendants washington july   president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion decisions are made asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city the last  cases in the investigation of the nov  election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the  persons he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens karns ruling pertained to eight of the  cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case contempt proceedings originally had been brought against  persons in  precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor issue jury subpenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about  persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the th precinct of the d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving  persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another the cases involved judges in the d th and d precincts of the st ward the st and th precincts of the th ward the th precinct of the th ward and the th precinct of the d ward the case of the judges in the th precinct of the d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns two other cases also were under advisement claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them washington feb   president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on  million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of  million americans over  who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build  new medical and  new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill it was defeated in congress last year cost up to  a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as  a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes the social security payroll tax is now  per cent  per cent on each worker and employer on the first  of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to  a year and the payroll tax to  per cent  per cent each similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system the payroll tax would actually rise to  per cent starting jan   if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by  per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to  billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run  billion or more in the first year  both figures would go higher in later years other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of  million to  billion dollars over the next  years these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over  who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems  full payment of hospital bills for stays up to  days for each illness except that the patient would pay  a day of the cost for the first nine days  full payment of nursing home bills for up to  days following discharge from a hospital a patient could receive up to  days paidfor nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit  hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of  a patient  community visiting nurse services at home for up to  days an illness the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals this is not a program of socialized medicine it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed every person will choose his own doctor and hospital wouldnt pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills they would still be paid by the patient apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools the president said the nations  medical and  dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to  a year for onefourth of the first year students the schools could use the money to pay year scholarships based on need of up to  a year per student in addition the government would pay a  cost of education grant to the schools for each  in scholarship grants officials estimated the combined programs would cost  million dollars the first year and would go up to  millions by  the president recommended federal matching grants totaling  million dollars in  years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones more for nursing homes in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present  million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction he asked for another  million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation he did not say by how much for medical research he asked a  million dollar a year increase from  to  millions in matching grants for building research facilities the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the  million dollars in the  budget for direct government research in medicine the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house washington feb   acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief only  senators were on the floor and there was no record vote a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a  hour delay after they are reported to the floor enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in  and president kennedys in  oslo the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicious by its absence explosion avoided in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole conflict surveyed the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled washington the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory gop restrained it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by  harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators detente urged this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed but thus far there has been no response in kind foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos some seato nations disagreed however there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he declared on march  that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna washington the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend offenses multiply the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett a special assistant ot the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since  each year showing an increase in offenders among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in  about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under  years of age east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time east providence now has no civil defense program mr hawksley the states general treasurer has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years he is not interested in being named a fulltime director noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about  a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized mr hawksley said one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drivein theater in seekonk would be another riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly the governors move into the socalled blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant deputy city clerk of central falls a copy was released to the press mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july  and sent to the state house by miss grant the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get the benefit of his views he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the councils resolution said the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government the council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on sunday they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labormanagement expert said here yesterday mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in  that he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade that was before i studied law some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track he steered me to the right track the free enterprise track he said that when he was a socialist in  the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties mr reama who retired as vice president of the american screw co in  said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his  philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling a petition bearing the signatures of more than  johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within  days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within  days he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within  days after the board of canvassers completes its work a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july  to plan further strategy in the charter movement he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than  members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at mondays special north providence town council meeting council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense plainfield  james p mitchell and sen walter h jones rbergen last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes democratic gubernatorial candidate that the gop is campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before  persons at the park hotel the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club it was greeted with a chorus of boos by  women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired now hes gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state sunday he had added we can love eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president  but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this he asked the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue regrets attack jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into rearguing an old national campaign the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry decries joblessness mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate must share the blame for this nothing that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you cant have it both ways jones said the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue defends ike earlier mitchell said in a statement i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit sees jones ahead sen charles w sandman rcape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination sandman state campaign chairman for jones was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel newark of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case rnj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington that failed we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year that too will fail sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of  woodland ave westfield as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman county supervisor weldon r sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them the proposal sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a lip service word sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a year period without interest or charge sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january  although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county was supported today by edward w roos west orange public safety commissioner sheeran a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organizations candidate freeholder william macdonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy now a member of the state board of tax appeals my experience as public safety commissioner roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer jim sheeran fits that description trenton  william j seidel state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development has retired after  years of service a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state seidel joined the department in  as a

is credited with setting up an annual cooperative fire prevention program in cooperation with the red cross and state department of education boonton  richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state he promised nearly  democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn when i come back here after the november election youll think youre my man youre the kind of governor were glad we elected he said we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time attacks republicans in his only attack on the republicans hughes said the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary but well have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson well take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early s calling the democrats

monday conservation plan the plan will provide  million for purchase of open land by the state the other  million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased  each year since  he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans after the primary he promised ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee trenton  fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring voluntarily this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues the outgoing members whose fouryear terms will expire a week after the april  primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by there may be other  state committee retirements come april  but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank who is stepping down after  years on the committee she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early s following adoption of the womens suffrage amendment she served one fouryear term on the national committee resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party opposition reported some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept  democratic primary these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader mayor visits buckley as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio the manhattan leader he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organizations acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this years ticket but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor screvane and beame hailed the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame who lives in brooklyn to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterdays new york times the mayor said it didnt come from me but as i have said before if i announce my candidacy i will have something definite to say about running mates boston june   a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same its see joe see jim he says the hand is out a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control  these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel the last hurrah but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in massachusetts public life day after day some new episode is reported the state public works department is accused of having spent  to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate washington june   congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition in the house the southernrepublican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administrations housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aidtoeducation bill the housing bill is now in the house rules committee it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans the democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week the  measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of  this would provide for longterm federal loans for construction of parochial and other privateschool facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps in the  budget that has been submitted for congressional approval  would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contractnegotiation stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview six of these were proposed by religious groups they will be for teaching agriculture and community development in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america question raised interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled when he protested the hotel owner said why do you worry the u s government is paying for it the u s government pays for all its overseas workers missionary explains i dont work for the government the american said im a missionary the hotel owner shrugged same thing he said and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical churchstate problem can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state r sargent shriver jr director of the corps is certain that they can no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes moscow

expansive mood of the successful banker indonesia is one of the twenty underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid the soviet union and other members of the

those countries united nations n y june   a committee of experts has recommended that a countrys population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations one effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india india is the most populous united nations member with more than  inhabitants the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations formula is due this week the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines  each of the organizations ninetynine members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start  each member would get one post for each  people in its population up to  people or a maximum of fifteen posts  each member with a population above

governmental developments in mississippi even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the states immediate political future this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants gov ross barnett barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well consequently it is uncertain after nearly  months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during  and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the  legislative session if barnett doesnt call a special session in  it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the  per diem is not certain and if they start agitating barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during  with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together future clouded barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen baton rouge la  the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in  with the governors theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from  per cent to  per cent the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation legislators weary indeed the administrations curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat the administration could not say why  million was needed for a grantinaid program the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration he could terminate special sessions of the legislature actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the  million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that  million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one but if the administration should find it does not need the  million for a grantinaid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues constant problem in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in  to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves the new year might see some housecleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city estimates of the citys loss in the  job have ranged as high as  shortcuts unnoticed hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co contracted to do the work at an impossibly low

contract called for overhauling of  joints the city paid for work on  of which no more than  were repaired hemphill charged wide range in bids hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of  for each joint the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass which listed the same officers as hughes was  per joint but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from  to  per joint bergers decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference wagner said the city paid only  to the hughes company we wont know the full amount until we get a full report wagner said we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond berger said wagner replied cant you just see the headline city hooked for  know enough to sue berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount douglas m pratt president of the ptc who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el we

he is married and the father of three children helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically e m martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night martin who has been in office in washington d c for  months spoke at the councils annual meeting at the multnomah hotel he told some  persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the soviet union he cited east germany where after  years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up martin called for patience on the part of americans the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said individual help best we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said economically martin said the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portlands civil defense more plans for the citys schools in event of attack but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow the board members after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar  sw maplecrest dr said they thought they had already been cooperating chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go dr melvin w barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said nobody really expects to evacuate i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following mrs molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody on the local level and it wouldnt be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowes program the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be

white sox today austin texas  a texas halfback who doesnt even know the teams plays eldon moritz ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games time stands still every time moritz a yearold army signal corps veteran goes into the field although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick several every saturday in fact out of football moritz doesnt even have a nose guard or hip pads but hes one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl thats because he already has kicked  extra points in  tries he ran his string of successful conversions this season to  straight before one went astray last saturday night in the  slaughter of washington state moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the  team but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and youll get the quick response placekicker a pound foot inch senior from stamford moritz practices nothing but placekicking last year when he worked out at halfback all season he didnt get into a single game this year coach royal told me if id work on my placekicking he thought he could use me said moritz so i started practicing on it in spring training moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough moritz said monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson  in a  district game i kicked about  extra points in  tries during three years in high school he said and made  in a row at one time i never did miss one in a playoff game i kicked about  in the five playoff games my last two years moritz came to texas in  but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury he missed the  season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played  minutes in  his statistical record that year when texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of  yards punted once for  yards and caught one pass for  yards he went into the army in march  and returned two years later but he was scholastically ineligible in  and merely present last season place kicking is largely a matter of timing moritz declared once you get the feel of it theres not much to it ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel practice helps you to get your timing down its kind of like golf if you dont swing a club very often your timing gets off moritz however kicks only about  or  extra points during each practice session if you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained  footnotes in their first three games the longhorns have had the ball  times and scored  times or  per cent  their total passing yardage in three games  on  completions in  attempts is only  yards short of their total passing yardage in  when they made  on  completions in  tries  tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season when he netted  yards on  carries he now has  yards in  tries during three games  saxton has made only one secondhalf appearance this season and that was in the washington state game for four plays he returned the kickoff  yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench  wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists hell be ready for oklahoma  last week when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conferences top four in rushing he said that wont last long it didnt monday he had four longhorns in the top four  a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday but attention quickly turned from saturdays victory to next weeks problem rice university the mustangs dont play this week were just real happy for the players coach bill meek said of the  victory over the air force academy i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on it was the first time weve been ahead this season when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal assistant coach john cudmore described victory as a good feeling i think on the part of the coaches and the players we needed it and we got it meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon both turned in top jobs for the second straight game nelson played magnificent football meek praised he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown he broke that boy air force fullback nick arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages one was on a fourthdown screen pass from the mustang  after an incomplete pass into gannons territory as soon as it started to form gannon spotted it meek said he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback terry isaacson had time to turn around he really crucified him  he nailed it for a yard loss the air forces and the games final play was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own  and returned  yards he just lay back there and waited for it meek said he almost brought it back all the way except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game meek said hell be out of action all this week he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland hes looking a lot better and hes able to run meek explained well let him do a lot of running this week but i dont know if hell be able to play the game players saw the air force film monday ran for  minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for  minutes well work hard tuesday wednesday and thursday meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage friday well work out about an hour on saturday then well work monday and tuesday of next week then taper off smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday oct  huddle hearsay  held out of texas techs sweatsuits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford who is undergoing

who broke a hand in the owls game with lsu was back working out with rice monday and john nichols sophomore guard moved back into action after a weeks idleness with an ankle injury  the texas aggies got a day off monday a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night but myers announced that halfback george hargett shaken up in the tech game would not play against trinity saturday  halfback bud priddy slowed for almost a month by a slowlymending sprained ankle joined tcus workout monday the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts a  triumph over the denver broncos but their visit will be a short one the texans have two more road games at buffalo and houston before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach hank strams men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in preseason reckonings buffalo coach buster ramsey who has become one of the games greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two exnational football leaguers m c reynolds and warren rabb rabb the former louisiana state field general came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a  upset victory over the houston oilers defending league champions just our luck exclaimed stram buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spikes though he did the teams placekicking while nursing a knee injury our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only  passes we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explained stram they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes the flashy halfback he was called upon  times more than all of the other ballcarriers combined and delivered  yards the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denvers al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas a quick touchdown resulted that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said stram quipping i think ill put that play in the book the early southwest conference football leaders texas arkansas and texas am made a big dent in the statistics last week texas yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a game total offense of  yards  rushing and  passing a new swc high arkansas combined  yards rushing with  yards passing on  completions in  tosses and a tough defense to whip tcu and am with a point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since  completing  of  passes for  yards the aggies had a total offense of  yards texas leads in pergame rushing averages  yards and passing  to baylors  but idle baylor has the best defensive record  yards per game to texas  am has the best defense against passes  yards per game not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use the major leagues have ordered their own tests which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis  the husky  pound lefthander was in command all the way before an onthescene audience of only  and countless of television viewers in the denver area it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning he has given only the one pass in his  innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw the bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in sundays opener and never lagged dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bears attack after al paschal gruonded out jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don werts smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzers glove nischwitz was working on a hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines infielder roller accounted for the tallies the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusiks double and outfield flies by porter and wert gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth despite the degree weather the game was clicked off in  thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusiks grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base bingles and bobbles cliff cook accounted for three of the tribes eight hits  it was the seasons first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order  the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark  mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ  among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer patti waggin who is mrs don rudolph when off the stage  lefty wyman carey another denver rookie will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at

drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a  victory over the chicago white sox monday lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center he came all the way around on gardners hit before  fans it was gardners second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year turk lown was tagged with the loss his second against no victories while ray moore won his second game against a single loss the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny greens double to left the white sox had taken a  lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon a walk and a sacrifice fly jim landis foot

baser an infield single by lemon and gardners solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth ogden utah may  ap  boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball ive had it he told a newsman i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any th man on the ball club this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout jensen got only six hits in  atbats for a  batting average in the first  games he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno nev where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited she said when she learned jackie was heading home im just speculating but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances the union pacific railroad streamliner city of san francisco stopped in ogden utah for a few minutes sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him the conductor said to ritchie i dont think you want to talk to him youll probably get a ball bat on the head hes mad at the world but jackie had gone into the station ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand i told him who i was and he was quite cold but he warmed up after a while i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a doublecrosser and said anything he liston got was through a keyhole he said he had never talked to liston liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying i cant hit anymore i cant run i cant throw suddenly my reflexes are gone just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging and so it was over the weekend what with yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying homer spree sunday both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahns hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the scoreyear milestone and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was  and a topgrade big leaguer  the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball players ball player as they say in the trade i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct   before a new record crowd for the period of   spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another allout guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse the spectacular mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may  joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings incidentally only two did it before a home audience bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies the braves joe adcock lou gehrig of the yankees pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito then with cleveland made their history on the road  willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee the record books however would favor the giants ace in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as  home runs and stole as many as  bases once the figure was  willies lifetime batting average of  is  points beyond mickeys the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukees park it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump  the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball  minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the games top rulers the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy this year i am told the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game cincinnati ohio ap  the powerful new york yankees won their th world series in a game romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating  barrage monday in the loosely played finale with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries the american league champs still mounted a hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game johnny blanchard mantles replacement slammed a run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a run first inning hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a run homer off bill henry during another run explosion in the fourth the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors the crowd of  had only two chances to applaud in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about  feet away with two men on momentarily the reds were back in the ball game trailing only  but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out in the fifth wally post slashed a run homer off bud daley but by that time the score was  and it really didnt matter the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager only bucky harris the boymanager of washington in  and eddie dyer of the st louis cardinals in  had accomplished the feat philadelphia jan   nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between  and  a year he succeeds buck shaw who retired at the end of last season the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff jerry williams and charlie gauer williams is a defensive coach gauer works with the ends choice was expected the selection had been expected skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry van brocklin the quarterback who led the eagles to the title was signed by the vikings last wednesday philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing in the past the club depended largely on van brocklins aerials skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack split between running and passing coach played  years skorich who is  years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers an injury forced skorich to quit after the  season he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in  he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy n y he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers

of missouri golfs golden boy arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months he won the masters the united states open and a record  in prize money he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the  diamond studded hickok belt but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot a couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous  on a par hole it made him human and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all it was neither a spirit of selfsacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all the worlds best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher he boomed a yard drive then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance no margin for error on the narrow fairway of a yard hole arnold whipped into his second shot the ball went off in a majestic arc an outofbounds slice he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side it is possible that i overcorrected he said ruefully each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes so he wound up with a dozen it was a nice round figure that  he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an  in the texas open the idol of the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a  in the united states open their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully willies partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count stickler for rules how many is that jim asked willie at one stage of his excavation project thirteen said long jim nae man said willie ye must be countin the echoes he had a  palmers dozen were honestly earned nor were there any rules to save him if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book this knowledge has come in handy too his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway the ball floated downstream a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings yet he remains the fiercest of competitors hell even bull headon into the rules when he is sure hes right thats how he first won the masters in  it happened on the twelfth hole a yarder arnolds iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force ruling from on high i can remove the ball cant i asked palmer of an official no said the official you must play it where it lies youre wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules ill do as you say but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling he scored a  for the embedded ball a  with the provisional one the golfing fathers ruled in his favor so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers but after that  at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the  schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional footballs hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments the owners would like each club in the fourteenteam league to play

our pitching is much better than it has shown the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday six bucks over  until the bucs bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over  despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess  gino cimoli  bill virdon  bob clemente and dick groat each  dick stuart  don hoak  and bob skinner  bill mazeroski with  and hal smith with  were the only pirates dragging their feet perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs friend is off to a great start with a  record but isnt likely to see action here this week were getting friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good murtaugh said virdon has been blasting the ball no plunkers for him six bucs over  the pirates jumped off to an  start by may  last year when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season on last may  the cardinals stood at  ending a twoseason falloff on that milestone in  the birds were  on may  a year later they were  since  the st louis club has been below  on may  just four times the  team was off to a soso  beginning then fell as low as  on may  before finishing with  victories the  cards were  on may  but ended with  triumphs the clubs top since  then last season the birds tumbled as low as  on may  before recovering to make a race of it and total  victories since  the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the  dodger team those dodgers won their first  games and owned a  mark and a ninegame lead by may  the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new yorks  giants who dropped  of their first  they honored the battling billikens last night speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who in the words of coach john benington had more confidence in themselves than i did the most valuable player award was split three ways among glen mankowski gordon hartweger and tom kieffer in addition a special award was given to bob bevo nordmann the foot center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say dont worry coach well get em all right the trio who shared the mostvaluable honors were introduced by bob broeg sports editor of the postdispatch kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his allround excellent play mankowski the ballhawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis us nationally televised victory benington said ive never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills after the coach listed all the boys faults hartweger said coach before i leave here youll get to like me mrs benington admired gordons spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team as hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said i want to thank coachs wife for talking him into letting me play bob burnes sports editor of the globedemocrat presented bob nordmann with his award bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time within a week after the injury suffered in st louiss victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament nordmann was sitting on the bills bench doing what he could to help benington on the clock given him was the inscription for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball  other lettermen from the team that compiled a  record and finished as runnerup in the national invitation tournament were art hambric donnell reid bill nordmann dave harris dave luechtefeld and george latinovich this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future benington pointed out by winning against bradley kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesns take a super team to do it st louis university found a way to win a baseball game larry scherer last night pitched a nohit game said to be the first in billiken baseball history as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college  at crystal city the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie the tie was against southeast missouri last friday scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double len boehmer also was for with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at  against washington university at ligget field the game opened a busy week for washington the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at  tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy ill saturday happy hitting if its true that contented cows give more milk why shouldnt happy ball players produce more base hits the two top talents of the time mickey mantle and willie mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations and thats meant as a boost not a knock mays and mantle both year men at  have so much ability that baseball men agree theyve never hit the heights their heights that is mantle the bullnecked blond switchhitter had one sensational triplecrown season  when he batted  and also led the american league in home runs  and rbis  like the yankees slugger mays the terror of the giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by or for willie his best years were  when he hit  with  homers and  when he belted  home runs drove in  and stole  bases now apparently happier under new managers mays and mantle the perfect players are behaving as though theyre going to pass those previous peaks labor relations yes we know theyre professionals men paid to play and they shouldnt care how theyre handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month the truth is though that men react differently to different treatment for that matter stan musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort mantle its apparent resented casey stengels attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility the old man was almost too possessive stengel inherited dimaggio rizzuto but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors from joplin to new york with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him ol case wanted no  to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter baserunner and outfielder stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats inheriting a more mature mantle who now has seen the sights on and off broadway ralph houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on mickey the major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far the opinion continues here that with a game schedule pitching spread thin through a team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books babe ruths  homers of  four for alvin mays day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year willies wonderful walloping sunday four home runs served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark next to leo durocher dark taught mays the most when he was a grassgreen rookie rushed up to the polo grounds  years ago this month to help the giants win a dramatic pennant romantic

grayhaired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo ny is a civilian with the army her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director the job also covers a number of other items mom marr as the more than  men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written and during may which is national salvation army week there are plenty schedules to be made or problems to be solved mrs marrs office is always open and the welcome mat is out mrs marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men mrs marr explained the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center and i bum tickets to everything i can she said ive become the greatest beggar in the world in addition to the tickets to the movies sporting events and concerts mrs marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system mrs marr also has a number of parolees to mother watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society by midjune millions of americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land in another four weeks with schools closed across the nation the great allamerican summer safari will be under way by july  six weeks from now motelkeepers all over the nation will by  pm be switching on that bleak to motorists sign no vacancy no matter how many americans go abroad in summer probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car throw suitcases kids and comic books in the back seat and head for home and where is home that magic place of the heart ah that is simple home is where a man was born reared went to school and most particularly where grandma is that is where we turn in the good old summertime the land lies ready for the coming onslaught my husband and i a month ahead of the rush have just finished a day motor journey of  miles from tucson ariz to new york city set for influx i can testify that motels service and comfort stations they go together like scots and heather dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent farflung overnight accommodations maybe motelkeeping isnt the nations biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway there are motels for all purposes and all tastes there are even motels for local weather peculiarities as i discovered in shamrock tex there the royal motel advertises all facilities vented heat air conditioned carpeted free tv storm cellar many with pools innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools swim at your own risk is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools some even boast two pools one for adults and one for children but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar motorists like myself who can remember the old tourists accommodated signs on farm houses and village homes before world war ii can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fastgrossing motel business all for  at the boxwood motel in winchester va we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite an elegant affair with walltowall carpeting gold and white furniture pink satin brocade chairs inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels all for  that made up for the best motel in norman okla where the

decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b  o operates salary cut and layoffs it will be accomplished in two ways  a flat reduction of  per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions there are about  officers and employees in this class  sufficient layoffs of union employees to bring about a  per cent cut in the union payroll expense since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a bo spokesman said those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the layoffs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the

of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what the proposal was made by dr david s jenkins after he and mrs d ellwood williams jr a board member and longtime critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this weeks meeting the disagreement was over what dr jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting cites discrepancies mrs williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr jenkinss conversation and how they were written up for the boards approval i hate to have these things come up again and again dr jenkins commented as he made his suggestion these are the boards minutes ill write what you tell me to for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago it was about that time a board member said later that dr thomas g pullen jr state superintendent of schools told dr jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him the board of county

were last month werner criticized conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm mr schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall mr schaefer said the councilman who is

that operations continued through the week what he did mr werner said was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest work resumed wednesday he said mr schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be strictly enforced admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked  if our small merchants are to survive recounting personal observations of clearance work the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow

found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon jan  the information he said would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy court cleared just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring watched for six months was broken remained untold the british defending lawyers who today increased from three to four demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury the chances of their clients would improve so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the

reduced greatly in size and also in complexity allowing a single propeller to be used the navy said the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work it was first tried out on a conventional submarine the albacore in  the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built reputedly it could outrun underwater the fastest destroyers it could reputedly go  miles without refueling and stay down

georgia constitution and state law taxexempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning of true university grade and meet its financial obligations without the taxexemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions the statement said the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation an emory spokesman indicated however that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if among other criteria all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies but their taxexempt status never has been challenged by the state emory is affiliated with the methodist church some church leaders both clerical and lay have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation urged in  the student newspaper the emory wheel as early as the fall of  called for desegregation from its beginning the trustees statement said friday emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning teaching research and study according to highest standards under christian influence are paramount in the emory university policy as a private institution supported by generous individuals emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education there is not now nor has there ever been in emory universitys charter or bylaws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race color or creed insofar as its own governing documents are concerned emory university could now consider applications from prospective students and others seeking applications from prospective students and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university irrespective of race color or creed corporate existence on the other hand emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia  when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory taxexemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race color or creed continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education a young man was killed and two

in the category leaving only  for the rest of the month at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month this could mean a shortage of as high as  but it probably will be less because of

of its newlyappointed commissioners roy webster of hood river and dr ennis keizer of north bend approved a years contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of

to a maximum of  hours a month field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes acting administrator andrew f juras said that because of fields unique position and knowledge in the program the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles and he said he personally regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave salary termed modest juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government he also said that the salary in terms of going rates in the field was modest in terms of the mans responsibility the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet

technicians with narrow training and little wisdom are endangering crops and wildlife carl w buchheister president of the national audubon society said today it is like handing a loaded  automatic to an yearold and telling him to run out and play he commented buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target the fire ant but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop he said the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming there have even been serious errors in the u s forest service whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training he added the news of their experiments reach the farmers who forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries buchheister told the delegates in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill creation of national seashore parks including point reyes preservation of the wetlands where birds breed a pesticides coordination act stronger water pollution control programs and federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution

the annual meeting of the league at olney hall college of marin kentfield buchheister pledged the land would be an inviolate sanctuary for all birds animals and plants seventeen years ago today german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a v rocketbomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber the world war ii german bomber rolled down a runway and took off the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip this had never been done before now a quietspoken middleaged man fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheeds missiles and space division at sunnyvale where he played a key role in the development of the navys polaris missile he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in  the first two pilots had crashed he said i had developed the machines and therefore knew them it was time to go up myself fiedler was then technical director of hitlers supersecret reichenberg project which remained unknown to the allies until after the war about  of the special v rocketbombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead the target was allied shipping a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe the success of the project depended upon fiedlers flight squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rockets automatic guidance mechanism the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude at  feet fiedler signaled release and started the roaring pulsejet engine then streaked away from beneath the heinkel to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of  mph it was probably mans first successful flight in a missile she flew beautifully said fiedler there was only one power control a valve to adjust the fuel flow i had exactly  minutes to get down to the test strip using a steering system that controlled the modified rockets tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of  mph fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown and banked into the airfield moments later the v skimmed across the landing strip edging closer and closer to a touchdown then in a streamer of dust it landed fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water striking below the waterline of individual ships a crack corps of  pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers but the project was halted before the end of the war and the missiles later fell into allied hands now a family man with three children fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale his spare time is spent in soaring gliders its so quiet he said so slow serene and so challenging john di massimo has been elected president of the  columbus day celebration committee it was announced yesterday other officers are angelo j scampini

of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons otherwise no peace is possible governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the

under which germany will pay  to greek victims of nazi persecution it was announced today probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the dallasheadquartered company was tremendous it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell investors who wanted  shares in many cases ended up with  and customers who had put in a bid to buy  shares found themselves with  and counted themselves lucky to get that many in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than  shares some dallas investment firms got only  shares for all of their customers a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of  a share the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler guerin  turner the managing underwriter was at  a share and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around  a share but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold  to the public at  with another  reserved for morton foods employes at  a share there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering we subscribe  shares of morton foods of texas cable confirmation it said translated but egt could not let the swiss bank have even  shares after it allotted shares to  underwriters and  selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation i feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up as a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced at roughly  times  earnings to yield a little over  per cent on the c anticipated dividend second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks frito and h w lay on the market both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late foods which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher priceearnings ratios the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost  years in the competitive survival of the fittest but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is now if mortons newest product a corn chip known as chipos turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to dallas and north texas is known worldwide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued

association of america santa barbara  the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn beryl w sprinkel economist of harris trust  savings bank chicago predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn california group conference another speaker william h draper jr former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper gaither  anderson urged the us to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we wont be pushed arouny any more he urged support for president kennedys requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations not flash in pan sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern in view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in  nor as severe as in late  and  thesis refuted sprinkel strongly refuted the current neostagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence rather than viewing the abortive recovery in  as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery danger cited he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in  the unsatisfactory  expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike sacrifices needed draper declared as i see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today we must justify our heritage we must be ready for any needed sacrifice he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration that russia respects our show of strength but that presently were not acting as we should and must he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do while he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro for unless we do were liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i dont believe we can permit that new york ap  stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery erasing all of mondays losses in the associated

industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom creations needed as we look to the  billion economy that is predicted for  and the increase of about  in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed peterson said with this kind of new product logjam the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the shortterm advantage which it often needs nothing to fear peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas he cited as an example how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs by improving its production knowhow and technology he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an

chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales weve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for  more we sold only four pickers all last year gus ehlers competitor of mr houtz in this farm community says his business since august  is running  above a year earlier before then my sales during much of the year had lagged behind  by  he says though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas paradoxically the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output although the administrations program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since  farmers with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently the higher price supports provided by the new legislation together with rising prices for farm products are pushing up farm income making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly  above last year in august our dealers sold  more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were  higher than last year says mark v keeler farm equipment vice president of international harvester co for the year to date sales of the companys farm equipment dealers still lag about  behind  two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states two out of three report their sales since august  show sizable gains from a year earlier with the increases ranging from  to  not all sections are showing an upswing however the droughtseared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products more than  million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nations trucks buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances chemicals and other products farmers are so eager for new machinery that theyre haggling less over prices than they did a year ago dealers report farmers arent as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale says jack martin who sells j i case tractors and implements in sioux city iowa this morning we allowed a farmer  on the old picker he traded in on a new  model last year we probably would have given him  for a comparable machine mr martin sold  tractors in august in august of  he sold seven dealers stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about  below a year ago the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the countrys farm equipment manufacturers for example farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about  above a year earlier mr keeler reports tractor production at masseyferguson ltd of toronto in july and august rose to  units from  in the like period a year earlier says john staiger vice president with the lower dealer inventories and the steppedup demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements merritt d hill ford motor co vice president says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers except for a few months in late  and early  retail farm equipment sales have trailed yearearlier levels since the latter part of  the rise in sales last winter was checked when the governments new feed grain program was adopted the program resulted in a cutback of around  in planted acreage and as a result reduced the immediate need for machines nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects total farm output for this year is officially forecast at  of the  average three points higher than the july  estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for  the government also is aiding farmers income prospects agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers  billion in special subsidies and incentive payments well above the record  billion of  and about double the  million of  price support loans may total another  billion this year with cash receipts

kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling the supreme court decision in mid was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined the company in figuring its taxable earnings deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products such depletion allowances in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground not to the revenue from finished products a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the rulings impact on prioryear returns still under review for claymining companies that make brick and tile products the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to  of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone president kennedy in signing the relief measure into law stressed he regarded it as an exception my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries the president said  charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the irs the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to

deductible expense as permitted under us tax law the revenue service disallowed the claim invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was taxexempt income the tax court rejected this view it said the taxfreedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations

to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income in that event they note the revenue service might declare the pension plan is

class on food the pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy last october he gave a public speech in washington dc entitled are women here to stay so you can see that gerald g ramsey director of smus food services is not the ordinary type of craven womentrodden chef he is apt to rear back and claim his rights  ramsey as smus food wrangler buys enough groceries to serve  meals a week tell that to the little wife when she moans at the womans burden he also dishes up  snacks and he operates three cafeterias in the student center along with mcelvaney dining hall and the athletes tables ramsey   and ruggedly slim says i cant remember when i didnt pester my mother to teach me to cook  he was in charge of the hockaday school meals from  to  before he moved to smu and youll notice that in both places there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line what does he feed his smu football mastodons at the training table mostly meat and potatoes they have to have that gogogo without getting too fat says ramsey so he hides the mayonnaise and to keep athletes stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress he bans all highly flavored condiments  what do the pretty smu girls like on their plates pretty much hamburger hotdogs steak and at night maybe pizza says the handsome food expert unfortunately there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower ramsey has stoked up harry truman henry cabot lodge the king of morocco clement atlee and other shiny characters once four tibetan monks in their saffron robes filed through the cafeteria line they arent supposed to look at women you know ramsey recalled what with all those pretty girls around they had a hard time chicken cadillac use one ounce chicken breast for each guest salt and pepper each breast dip in melted butter and roll in flour place side by side in a inch deep baking pan bake slowly about one hour at  f until lightly brown add enough warmed cream seasoned to taste with onion juice to about half cover the chicken breasts bake slowly at least onehalf hour longer while this is baking saute mushrooms fresh or canned in butter sprinkle over top of chicken breasts serve each breast on a thin slice of slowbaked ham and sprinkle with thompson seedless grapes leave off the ham and you call it chicken pontiac says ramsey contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straightline modern but has sculptured pattern many design facets warmth dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the s and s two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated but warm look in contemporary these two heritage and drexel chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece but a collection of correlated designs each of which could stand alone the heritage collection to be shown by sangerharris and andersons studio has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time called perennian to indicate its lasting good today and tomorrow quality the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces walnut wormy chestnut pecan three varieties of burl handwoven philippine cane ceramic tiles marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors brick or paneled walls windows that bring in the outdoors it is a collection with a customdesign look offering simplicity with warmth variety and vitality the drexel collection called composite to be shown by titches offers a realistic approach to decorating a mature modern that is a variation of many designs rounded posts give a soft sculptured look paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia a highlegged buffet provides easytoreach serving a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end recessed arched panels decorate a inch long chest an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented with a young basic functional group of chests dressers and corner units and a canted headboard the other bedroom has heavier styling doorfronted dressers with acacia panels a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror colorful bright eastman chromspun fabrics with the magenta pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexels fall  group composite the spiderleg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top seethrough design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor to bring warmth to the dining area golden orange tones are used in the fabrics dignity and comfort in a contemporary manner reflecting the best aspects of todays design with substance and maturity keynote the perennian collection from heritage center panel handscreened wood actually is a back of one of

husband stephen fled to vienna there they continued their studies at the university she in art he in architecture and there she had her first showing of tapestry work theres a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today what most people dont seem to realize if they arent tied up with the thing as i am is that  of the problem is transportation i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school getting to and from school was no problem they either walked or were driven  now they go to a high school that is two miles away one might think the problem would be similar they could walk ride on a bus or be driven its much more complex than that generally they go to school with a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails a certain loss of social status a young man doesnt like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isnt even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl why dont you walk to school then i suggested my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois did you i was asked no i said i didnt happen to grow up in illinois i explained however that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom  i had to ride a streetcar two miles sometimes the streetcar was late sometimes there werent even any seats i had to stand up with the ladies sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car she has to have at least one car herself i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman even that isnt satisfactory if they have to take any car theyd rather take the big one they say that when they take a car gloriana doesnt take her car but rides with them but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isnt big enough  the logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself the solution naturally is the bus however its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and its too hard on my legs my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there but thats hardly realistic nobody walks any more but crackpots and harry truman and hes already got an education advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names

switzerland heres an idea for a childs room that is easy to execute and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than put away in boxes displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent to create such a lamp order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the puppets head make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base in this way you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the pedestal if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your childs whims although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a childs playtime those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merrygoround the scalloped edge is particularly appealing todays trend toward furniture designs from americas past is teaching homeowners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions in the background lurked the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the utilitarian touch so juniors bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only this isnt true of the many homemakers of the s according to decorator consultant leland alden housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says mr alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical solid investment there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop down to earth designs

teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from  to  pm sunday at first presbyterian church at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged a young real estate salesman kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it when he attended the christian anticommunist crusade school here about six months ago jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it the best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote a biblically strong christianity so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than  top teenagers and  adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days by ted place director of greater miami youth for christ and jon braun director of campus crusade for christ the second half of the film communism on the map and the movie operation abolition also will be shown response to the program has been so encouraging kern said that a citywide youth school at

at the opera house is i think the finest classical ballet company i have ever seen and the production of the petipatschaikowsky sleeping beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing this work is no favorite of mine i am prepared to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of selfplagiarisms all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya in other words no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests miss omsk miss pinsk miss stalingr  oops skip it these qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this companys collective personality it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet ohthepainofit that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety is totally absent from the kirov this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics but obviously at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned irina kolpakova the princess aurora of fridays performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable hit alla sizova who seems to have made a special hit in the east was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner yuri soloviev was wonderfully virile acrobatic and poetic all at the same time in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky vladilen semenov a fine danseur noble konstantin shatilov a great character dancer and inna zubkovskaya an excellent lilac fairy were other outstanding members of the cast but every member of the cast was magnificent the production designed by simon virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way it was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted pastellike style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra one containing excellent soloists the violin solos by the

entertainment of our guests for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies after all this years movies are next years television shows so i went to see la dolce vita it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film if thats all the romans did its a surprise to me that rome fell after television la dolce vita seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week i believe tv watchers will be bored la dolce vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western week in week out there is more sex to be seen in the adventures of ozzie and harriet there is more decadence on  sunset strip there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any privateeye series  in another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face a frigid beauty and three silly fairies put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of dull apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining  as a moral shocker it is a dud but this doesnt detract from its merit as an interesting if not great film the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories and when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing  tonight atlantic

pressure can get the best of any of us at last the white house is going to get some muchcopied furniture by that master american craftsman duncan phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u s presidents of the th century sent abroad for their furnishings the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansions library the suite has been in the same family since the early s the gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey whose famous estate tranquility was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover n j authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set  years ago this acquisition is a matched perfect set consisting of two sofas six feet long plus six sidechairs and two armchairs the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedys fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home it is the aids intention to create in the library a miniature museum of americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem mass an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in  the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace it will be painted to match the paneling in the room the aid committees chairman in charge of the redecoration mrs henry francis lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project mrs lenygons committee associates announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel both wellknown manhattan decorators regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e barnes of boston president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard n c but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music at  p m the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians students from the ages of  to  who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp and to greet the  crippled cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert it was the first in the series of concerts for young people by young people to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house she was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port mass and in his welcoming remarks the president said he was representing her as he approached the open bandstand erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion the band struck up the star spangled banner and followed it with hail to the chief i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band and we are grateful to them president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl after paying tribute to the conductor and his whiteclad youthful students president kennedy said as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music he added  i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field displaying his knowledge of music the new englandborn president remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont by young americans and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the united states this is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as i do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the white house as he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests he expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde patricia holbrook  of mount rainier had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston the nuns there do a wonderful work the president commented patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected henry hall wilson a student at the music camp  years ago and now on the presidents staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives turned guest conductor for a sousa march the stars and stripes forever transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary letitia baldrige told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring he said he contacted a friend henry hall wilson on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the student north carolina group to play the first concert one of the most interested students on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house was letitia baldrige social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy i was an art major in college miss baldrige explained ive been here so many times i couldnt count them she turned out to be a fan too of margaret bouton the gallerys associate curator of education miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at  p m the brevard group of  arrived at the gallery at  p m remaining for about  minutes the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later they decided that they thought rembrandts selfportrait made him look sad they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphaels alba madonna and texture in a monet painting of rheims cathedral everybody had heard of van gogh the french impressionist gallery director john walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery is the only museum in the country to have a fulltime music director  richard bales  im sure youve heard af him  and his record the confederacy along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards in  minutes the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late th century a few of them said they preferred contemporary art among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were boucher courbet fra angelico the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallerys rotunda fountain  because its on the second floor that imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at  th st nw took on bustling life yesterday more than  scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay

frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often that he didnt help around the house and that he didnt really care about the family she accused him of ignoring her he in turn told her she demanded too much they were both discouraged disgusted and miserable mary decided she had had enough

not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze for crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev mr kennedy replied  im hopeful that from  more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable but he was convinced that the realities of power military economic and ideological were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy last friday the white house announced president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june  and  the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in eastwest relations the heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the presidents change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader he was not going to vienna to negotiate the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war  road to vienna the u s and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in  introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations the first time was in  when a fulldress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east in  president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s that meeting produced the spirit of camp david a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement on the third occasion another big four summit session at paris a year ago there was no problem of an illusory spirit premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s for the u incident the episode tended to confirm the u s belief that propaganda the hope of onesided concessions and the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were the soviet leaders real aims in summitry preinaugural position thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words as long as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations the president had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary he wanted time too to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchevs doorstep attitude flexible at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe mr khrushchevs intentions and to make clear his own views moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions both elements the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia late in february the letter dated feb  was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march  it dealt mainly with a broad range of eastwest issues but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted developments over the next two months however caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly deadlock on tests the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery in the u s strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to communist china the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting at the same time there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the wests ability and determination to resist communist pressure in cuba the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep in laos the picture was almost equally bad u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on soviet terms beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warnings that they might do so allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure in the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may  made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may  after consultation with the allies the response from london paris and bonn was favorable firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week apparently at the insistence of the u s the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting the washington announcement said  the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries the meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries  the outlook the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned yearold veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedys own words is shrewd tough vigorous wellinformed and confident and a yearold president his birthday is may  with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval and disapproval the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway this time the initiative came in part at least from washington other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse after cuba and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds moreover the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory mollusks are a case in point the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence there is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy official encouragement is one thing but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit d corps of the religious community it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business this familycommunity spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement  it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also coeducational this is not an isolated example this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there is another aspect of the family business spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence at the earlier preacademic excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders become more pressing  the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for commenting on the earlier stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking noted that the term teacheremployee as opposed to eg maintenance employee was a not inapt description today however the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it even with the best of intentions he the president of the university is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered as it must be by him in individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying temperament interests and capabilities it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that oftrepeated phrase the attainment of excellence the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family  just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions adequate compensation is indispensable yet adequate compensation and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the ingroup that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busywork and ersatz decision making in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all in the notre dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheontable communication in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy ie members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally or in the words of anatole france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellans hearings into corruption in labormanagement relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program in addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike business week aug   reports that the united aircraft company against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating the company incurred some  million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers the company has billed the united states government for  of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractors business rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee the committee remains unresponsive neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the antimonopoly laws to the unions  the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the antitrust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained the antitrust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines it must play a game in which there never is a winner the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy let us look at the heavyelectricalgoods industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market the industry is so structured that pricesetting by a multiproduct company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated whether marginal or average pricing is applied the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition but if they show selfrestraint they dont get the orders under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a wideopen consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows in other words the antitrust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday  the question might be asked dont the managements of the heavyelectricalgoods manufacturers know these facts why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws the past usefulness of the antitrust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in  he wrote p   the antitrust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure p   antitrust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship p   when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control  in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the antitrust laws pp   in any event it is obvious that the antitrust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government this escape from control has led to managements evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license the penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in antitrust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle however one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the antitrust laws are effective and rational quite clearly the antitrust laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union those who favor placing trade unions under antitrust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform before  individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in  implicit in the writing of section a of the national industrial recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle the wagner act the tafthartley act and the landrumgriffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining the basic purpose of an effective collectivebargaining system is the removal of wages from competition if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession the problem must be faced squarely if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them human labor was exactly that a commodity in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury america as early as  adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work but many against combining to raise it eighteenthcentury england upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies in  the boston house carpenters strike for a tenhour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared it is  considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to  effect the value of labor  tend to convert all its branches into monopolies there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly the courts shared the opinion of the employers in people vs fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declared without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it but the right does not exist to raise  the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means compare this statement of a nineteenthcentury judge with how congressman martin according to the daily labor report of sept   defends the necessity of enacting antitrust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment senator mcclellan is proposing the application of antitrust measures to unions in transportation his bill allegedly aimed at hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norrislaguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the antitrust act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the antitrust act indeed it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the antitrust laws for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of antitrust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the antimonopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates  the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies it was most effective against trade unions in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment in  the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the antitrust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity the law could not suspend economics labor remained a commodity but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the antitrust laws the courts by interpretation emasculated the act in  the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company the company sued under the antitrust laws alleging that the unions activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce the nation the threefront war at a closeddoor session on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on us affairs abroad afterward tennessees democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen what herter presented said gore was not a very encouraging review that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions  cuba hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and drastic demand within  hours the us had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons the embassy staff alone totaled  us citizens plus  cuban employees president eisenhower held an  am meeting with top military and foreignpolicy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately there is a limit to what the united states in selfrespect can endure said the president that limit has now been reached through secretary herter ike offered presidentelect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision kennedy through secretarydesignate of state dean rusk declined he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan  although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the us and latin america see the hemisphere  laos after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the prowestern government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam in view of the present situation in laos said the pentagons announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific cutting short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines on the uss island base of okinawa task force  made up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move southward on signal but by weeks end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist rather than a prowestern government might be best for laos french  indians there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other coldwar fronts political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war and they were probably right it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again said one military man but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground at geneva in  to get the war in indochina settled the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet nam which then predictably became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the  geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of seato the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian arms drops in laos using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time soviet premier khrushchev sent new years hopes for peace to presidentelect kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply considering the state of the whole world the cold wars three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous but in senator gores words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day the congress turmoil in the house as the th congress began its sessions last week liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor the liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group had fought the committee before and had always lost this time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable they had the unspoken support of presidentelect kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will deadly deadlock there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee  to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservativeliberal deadlock or  to remove one of the conservatives namely mississippis term william meyers colmer pronounced calmer caucusing the liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the house is next to godliness a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than his  years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents he is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an antinegro speech for  years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee there his vote along with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge and the four republican members could and often did produce a  deadlock that blocked farout democraticsponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the rayburnjohnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes equal treatment there was sufficient pretext to demand colmers ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the antikennedy electors in mississippi reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons in  the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their  rebellion against harry truman and in  after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in  his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage in the heat of the anticolmer drive last week judge smith threatened reprisal against powell said he we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with presidentelect kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee and that he was the only man who could do anything effective in a tense closeddoor session with judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee two democrats including one southerner and one republican smith flatly rejected the offer and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man news of rayburns commitment soon leaked out when missouris clarence cannon got the word he turned purple unconscionable he shouted and rushed off to the speakers room to object a dangerous precedent cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the smithcolmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal porkbarrel projects sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally georgias carl vinson chairman of the armed services committee threat of war as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose his highest count of supporters numbered  and he needed nearly twice that number to control the member democratic caucus the liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes in the democratic committee on committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the house before they could oust colmer one big question if colmer was to be purged what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors in all three arenas they seemed certain of victory especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war if the southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party with that possibility in mind arkansas wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of facesaving compromise here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader one wants a little more power and the other doesnt want to give up any battle in the senate the senate launched the th congress with its own version of an ancient liberalconservative battle but in contrast with the houses guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guides speech question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate and thereby cut off legislationdelaying filibusters a wideranging bipartisan force from minnesotas democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills new mexicos clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senates notorious rule  to allow threefifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hardtoget twothirds fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators georgias dick russell objected politely and the battle was joined privately the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage privately they also admitted that their hopes for clint andersons threefifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon in  nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week hopefully the perennial battle of rule  then would be fought to a settlement once and for all republicans last act since election day vice president richard nixon had virtually retired by his own wish from public view but with the convening of the new congress he was the public man again presiding over the senate until john kennedys inauguration one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight  presidential election nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration this is the first time in  years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves gary player the small trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his  years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap arnold palmer the defending champion lost his title on the nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament and that is just what happened on the last few holes the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer player was the first to feel its teeth after playing a splendid first nine holes in  two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament sundays fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed players game rapidly fell to pieces he bogeyed the th after a journey through woods and stream he doublebogeyed the th he bogeyed the th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a overpar  and a hole total of  as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course player was almost in tears he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer by then playing the th hole was leading him by a stroke palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the nd hole he seemed to have the championship won but the seveniron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower afterwards palmer told charlie coe his lastround partner that he simply played the hole too fast he did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by  feet palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt palmers  for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a secondplace tie with coe the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight  end at seven until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing oneoverpar  this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of  and  his threeround total of  was three strokes better than the next best score a  by bill collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long but palmer knew as did everybody else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken half an hour after he finished his round player holed out at the th green with a  and a threeround total of  four strokes ahead of palmer more than a streak had ended long after the erratic climate and the washedout final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes the  masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmers towering prestige as if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments player won only one but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere on the final round at pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous  to palmers  thereafter until the masters player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami when they reached augusta last week together they had won five of the  tournaments to date instant rivalry on thursday the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and player developed instantly it was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flagstick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences palmers underpar  got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg but player was only one stroke back with a  even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever that this tournament was to be essentially a match between palmer and player a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a  or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky  but was bound to do better or rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augustas treacheries or even old byron nelson whose excellent  made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe on friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus rosburg had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were on the course separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a  was not having a good day as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the th on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament he birdied the th the th and the th five birdies one bogey and  pars for a  starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the nd the th the th and the th four birdies one bogey and  pars for a  the roar of palmers gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of players gallery for a similar triumph at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a foot putt on the th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had palmer proceeded to sink his footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply the boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence the bad luck that can so often mar a wellplayed round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions bob jones played that way byron nelson did hogan did and last week at the masters palmer and player did as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was players superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead this day palmer had started first as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was  under par for the day player immediately proceeded to follow suit in fact he went on to birdie the th and th as well to go  under par for the first eight holes but players real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring  yards he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the th and first fairways having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than  yards out player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the th fairway and settling for a bogey  or gambling the latter involved hitting a full fourwood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered th green i was hitting the ball well player said later and i felt strong when youre playing like that youd better attack player attacked with his fourwood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget it struck the th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par  palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles they started on the th hole a yard par on this day the wind had switched  from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days at the th tee palmer chose to hit a oneiron when a threewood was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green his bogey  on this hole and subsequent bogeys at  and  along with a birdie at  brought him back to even par starting the second nine palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees man of muscle drives a home run  feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime when roger eugene maris mantles muscular teammate powers four home runs in a doubleheader his performance merits awe but when tiny pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in   and  his achievement borders on the ridiculous this is baseball  this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous it is the year when  amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grandslam home runs  willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammates bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game  the milwaukee braves tied a majorleague record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them and  catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinchhitter pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knockdown pitch is now illegal experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion whatever the reasons not in  years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records homerun division of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy this of course is baseballs most remarkable mark the  home runs hit in  by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete george herman babe ruth of the yankees since  fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruths record and each in turn has been thwarted what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruths amazing september surge in the final month of the  season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched double threat always in the abortive attacks upon ruths record one man alone a jimmy foxx  in  or a hank greenberg  in  or a hack wilson  in  made the bid but now for the first time since lou gehrig with  home runs spurred ruth on in  two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on  their names are mantle and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real after  games in  ruth had  home runs after  games in  mickey mantle has  roger maris  extend mantles and mariss present paces over the full  schedule of  games and mathematically each will hit more than  home runs this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them to better ruths mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record in ruths day and until this year the schedule was  games baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruths record will remain official unless it is broken in  games even on the basis of  games this is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now vicepresident of the chicago white sox it has to be easier with two of them how can you walk maris to get to mantle roommates neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict  home runs for himself although both concede they would like to hit  they stick primarily to the baseball players standard quote the important thing is to win the pennant but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle the american leagues most valuable player in  and  and maris the mvp in  each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs i hope roger hits  mantle says and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs and i hope i hit  the sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer mantles in dallas mariss in kansas city they are rooming together mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york international airport the three pay  a month for

room they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out mantle supplies the transportation a white  oldsmobile convertible and maris drives the minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium mantle maris and cerv probably share one majorleague record already among them they have fifteen children eight for cerv four for mantle and three for maris as roommates teammates and homerun mates mantle  who broke in with the yankees ten years ago and maris  who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball mantle in commerce okla maris in fargo nd as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the minors maris recalls i wished i had gone to oklahoma to an extent the two even look alike both have blue eyes and short blond hair both are  feet tall and weigh between  and  pounds but mantle incredibly muscular he has a inch neck looks bigger with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order maris purchases  suits from simpsons in new york mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at neimanmarcus in dallas and pays as much as  each light reading neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry millers tropic of cancer mantle so appreciated millers delicate literary style that he broadened teammates minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking what do you and mickey talk about at home a reporter asked maris recently to tell you the truth maris said mickey dont talk much this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative of the two mantle is by nature the less outgoing maris the more outspoken but last week when a reporter was standing near mantles locker mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote see that kid he said pointing to a darkhaired yearold boy thats yogi berras ill never forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says you stunk maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen when ive made a dumb play he says i dont want to talk to anyone im angry by his own confession maris is an angry young man benched at tulsa in  he told manager dutch meyer i cant play for you send me where i can play meyer sent him to reading pa benched at indianapolis in  he told manager kerby farrell im not learning anything on the bench play me farrell did and maris led the team to victory in the little world series thats the way i am he says i tell people what i think if youre a good ballplayer youve got to get mad give me a team of nine angry men and ill give you a team of nine gentlemen and well beat you nine out of ten times idols idols one good indication of the two mens personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes mariss was ted williams when i was a kid maris told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice are you kidding said maris youre afraid to talk to a guy you idolize mantles hero was joe dimaggio when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman an exyankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his but dimaggio never said a word it crushed mickey he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him mantle has kept the vow among all the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for  an hour paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would lay ties on a railroad track if working in a zinc mine which he once did for  cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate on baseball they try to play baseball the best they can each is a complete ballplayer mantle beyond any question can do more things well one of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize mantle is headandshoulders above maris hitting mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both lefthanded and righthanded maris only lefthanded they both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings mantle is considerably better hitting for average  fourth in the league to  for maris so far this year both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate batting lefthanded to first base in  seconds faster than any other major leaguer maris ran the yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio the swift basestealing shortstop of the white sox both are good daring fielders mantle covers more ground mariss throwing arm is stronger yet with all their skills the appeal of mantle and maris in  comes down to one basic the home run with this ultimate weapon the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season

the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseballs lowest moment in  as the startling news that the  white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and

somewhat sly face g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europes best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh there the name vaguely connotes newrich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art last week in the german city of dusseldorf g david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause on display were  firstclass paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection and every single one of them was up for sale like philadelphias late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public time jan  thompson at  is something of a legend in his own lifetime he made his fortune during world war ii when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings he gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best he was able to smell a bargain and a masterpiece a continent away and the museum of modern arts alfred barr said of him i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didnt know about he might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough he bought up cezannes braques matisses legers a splendid picasso series more than  giacometti sculptures he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stones throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years he went then to a yearold basel art dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures last year beyeler arranged to sell  worth of klees to the state of north rhinewestphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built last week most of the other prizes once offered to pittsburgh went on the block at the opening of the dusseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town thompson himself said i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures break in georgia the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color but in all its  years not a single negro student has entered its classrooms last week federal district judge william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified negro boy and girl their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in georgia and in alabama mississippi and south carolina as well for  months hamilton holmes  and charlayne hunter  had tried to get into the university they graduated together from atlantas turner high school where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins holmes went to atlantas morehouse negro college where he is a b student and star halfback charlayne studied journalism at detroits wayne state university last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court judge bootle ordered them to apply again charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state but holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview the evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse no said he but officials still called him evasive they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested their reason holmes once paid a  speeding fine had his license suspended negro lawyers dug into the records of  white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes the real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school judge bootles decision the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color the state will appeal but few think it will actually try to close the university surprised and pleased students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week catch for chicago when the university of chicagos chancellor lawrence a kimpton submitted his

schools famous biology division since  but he has shown a sixthsense ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speechmaking beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters he avidly reads the wall street journal and took delight in driving a  model a ford for  years then selling it for  a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away the man was king leopold ii of the belgians who in  concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good by force he took under his protection or stole  square miles of wilderness in central africa this is an area nearly as large as western europe and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings they were determined by the points at which leopolds explorers and gunmen got tired of walking the population of the congo is  million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking  separate dialects the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done or failed to do in the congo since  at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property but by  its record of brutality had touched the national conscience the belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned only their judgment ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in  the congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in  was  and had until then been treated as an infant  the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil the colony was administered from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock in inside africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the united states government as a heavy partner had they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion but they were not they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent they put much effort into public housing they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food but instead of delivering the ration either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry the belgians also placed great emphasis on education during the s there were as many as  schools in the congo but almost all the schools were primary the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name some schools were technical the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science indeed the belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest when the congo received its independence in  there were among its  million people exactly  university graduates  why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it in one large oversimplification it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping africa they lacked time to prepare the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies the congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant and in brussels street crowds shouted pas une goutte de sang not one drop of blood the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess it is hard to blame them for this yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than  political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate there were four principal ones first there were those congolese among them joseph kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states balkanizing it second there were those moise tshombe who favored nearbalkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states third there were those notably patrice lumumba who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up however the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration they had divided the congo into six provinces leopoldville kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable westernstyle form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces wellwishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations if internal frictions arose they could be handled by the man congolese army the force publique which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man twentyfour hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other presently the wellarmed members of the force publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country the belgian government decided to act and on july  dispatched paratroops to the congo on july  the head of the mineralrich province of katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country confusion became chaos each succeeding day brought new acts of violence lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them  on july  the security council with france and great britain abstaining voted the resolution which drew the un into the congo vague in wording it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretarygeneral to take the necessary steps  to provide the congolese government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks  secretarygeneral hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were to come from african or at least nonwhite nations certainly not from the us russia great britain or france he quickly called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched troops within hours ultimately the un army in the congo reached a top strength of  including about  from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites it took the un three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed un efforts the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with the belgians and appealed to russia for help however there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist before appealing to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us for military help and was rejected lumumba further complicated the uns mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under albert kalonji wanted to secede as well meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly but by the end of the threemonth period in october  something approaching calm settled on the congo president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him lumumba fired kasavubu control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york the belgians at least officially departed from the congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops but they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga the seceded province which according to tshombe holds  of the mineral wealth of the entire country from october  to february  the un forces in the congo took little action there was no directive for it the security councils resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize it during the fivemonth lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo in february the murder of patrice lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe again stirred the un to action on feb  the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including  the use of force if necessary in the last resort although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one it also urged that the un eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ordered an investigation of lumumbas death urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army the presidency talking and listening though president john f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloys unexpected report from khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week high up on the presidents priority list was the thorny question of bizerte on this issue the president received a detailed report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson who had just returned from paris and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search for a facesaving way for both paris and tunis out of the imbroglio ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no  man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable through ladgham mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba and one us official said the key question now is which side picks up the phone first on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the interamerican economic and social council which the president himself had originally hoped to attend main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedys alliance for progress and that was not all in conferences with nationalist chinas dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy assured chiang kaisheks emissary that the us is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia however the president who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer mongolias admission comes to a vote the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid to africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a goodwill mission to the ivory coast all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs in effect he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason crime skyjacked from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston as the

legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass  to  the largest peacetime defense budget in us history with the money all but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of the  more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only  the holdback as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently in all the senate signed a check for  billion which not only included the extra  billion requested the week before by president kennedy but tacked on  million more than the president had

regarded as highly speculative things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought tollroad bonds when these securities ranked

bonds you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of  per cent or very close to that and

cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds its not much more in fact than the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds for investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a taxfree yield of  per cent is high it is the equivalent of  per cent for an unmarried investor with more than  of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than  of taxed income swelling traffic a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent month period ending in february or march shows what is happening the report is based on a survey by blyth  company investment bankers nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in  and early in  as a result of business recession many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter indication the longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward look for example at the ohio turnpike traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february as compared with those same months in  then march brought an  per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs as a result the roads net revenues in the  months ending march  were  per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds that was up from  per cent in the preceding  months that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike operating revenues were off in the first three months of  but up for the  months ending in march costs were held down despite a bitter winter for the year the road earned  per cent of its interest costs against  per cent in the preceding period the roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston slow successes some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do the mile illinois state toll highway for example was not opened over its entire length until december  in the  months ended in february  the highway earned enough to cover  per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves in the  months ended in february  this highway earned  per cent of its interest that improvement is continuing in the first two months of  earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up  per cent from early  success for many turnpikes has come hard traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways many rate increases already have been put into effect higher tolls are planned for july   on the richmondpetersburg va turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study easier access progress is being made too in improving motorists access to many turnpikes the kansas turnpike offers an illustration net earnings of that road rose from  per cent of interest requirements in calendar  to  per cent in the  months ended feb   further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in  with the opening of a new bypass at wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city kans and kansas city mo meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years for some roads troubles investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike if nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in  west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same these however are exceptions the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point   a top american official after a look at europes factories thinks the us is in a very serious situation competitively commerce secretary luther hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on may  toured plants of two of italys biggest companies fiat the auto producer and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines our staff man cabled from turin as follows follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this one modern equipment much of it supplied under the marshall plan enables fiat to turn out  cars a day about half of these are exported two wage costs are a fraction of the us costs a skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns  a week three labor troubles are infrequent fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years said secretary hodges its a tough combination for the us to face olivetti had a special interest for hodges olivetti took over underwood the us typewriter maker in late  within a year without reducing wages underwoods production costs were cut one third prices were slashed the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout modern machinery the firm is designconscious salesconscious advertisingconscious hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the us the inflow of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments hodges predicted i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the us there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas   foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these an international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet if they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible   at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to highwage textileproducing countries japan since  has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the us hong kong india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact none of these countries is happy with these arrangements the japanese want to increase exports to the us while they have been curbing shipments they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons the kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the lowwage textileproducing countries in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas gradual controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what president kennedy wants this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products its an important clue to washington thinking   note too that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us textile industry get competitive or get out in veiled terms thats what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesnt seem feasible special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed government research will look into new products and methods import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved but the kennedy administration doesnt favor import quotas rather they are impressed with the british governments success in forcing and helping the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries   among the highestpaid workers in the world are us coal miners yet us coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water steel company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about  a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines us coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting narrow and very deep productivity of us miners is twice that of the british welsh coal miners communistled are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal they threaten to strike the british government will have to decide whether to let us coal in the british coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it cant sell every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fivecent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically im sorry but we dont have that book there wouldnt be much demand for it im afraid behind this reply and its many variations is the everpresent budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest what to buy out of the years grist of nearly  book titles what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate a startlingly high percentage do not exceed  annually which includes the librarians salary and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs this in the worlds richest city the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds in some parts of the country however a cooperative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a countywide or regional basis new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these cooperative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york cooperative offers a crosssection of how the plan works at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a highdensity area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as  with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state it was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in  to establish fully the thriving systems of today under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit some library boards are wary of the plan a large wellstocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great a small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system all services are given without cost to members so obvious are these advantages that nearly  per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a coop  to set up a cooperative library system the law requires a central book collection of  nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars in nassau county for example the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since  this system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of  volumes by  the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in  to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans headquarters gets about  requests every day it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion freeport houses social science pure science and language history biography and education are centered in hempstead levittown has applied science business and literature while hewlettwoodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quartercentury but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library the system passes on these savings to its members further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing books are not the only resource of the system schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities the most recent film catalogue available at each library lists  titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook of the north the emperors nightingale and the red balloon workshops are conducted by the systems audiovisual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together consequently an experienced childrens librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote wellplanned library activities cooperating with the childrens librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits headquarters has also set up a central juvenile bookreview and bookselection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups story hours preschool programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the childrens consultant headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the childrens program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in mber libraries it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used and it publishes sum and substance a monthly newsletter which reports the systems activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries the system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership in nassau as in other systems the longrange objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans the teenagers to them especially the librarians with the help of coops hope they will never have to say im sorry we dont have that book today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world the need for lifetime reading is apparent education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read if we are not discriminating in our reading if we do not know how to use what we do read we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries although progress has been made in americas system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america the problem grows in intensity each year as mans knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition there are for example approximately  people in this country with no public library service and about  with inadequate service in college libraries  per cent of the total number of books are owned by  of  institutions surveyed last year by the us office of education and over  per cent of the elementary schools with  or more pupils do not have any library at all  in every aspect of service to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services only public understanding and support can provide that service this is one of the main reasons for national library week april  and for its theme for a richer fuller life read assembly session brought much good the general assembly which adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need longrange planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisistocrisis government this session for instance may have insured a financial crisis two years from now in all the turmoil some good legislation was passed some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue no action has been taken however on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but the empire state of the south we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation in the interim between now and next year we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgias very real economic fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics  league regularly stands on the side of right the league of women voters  now and admitting it proudly is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive its a good use of money these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jeffersons dictum that one must cherish the peoples spirit but keep alive their attention if once they become inattentive to the public affairs jefferson said you and i and congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public the harder the choice the more willing the league is to wade in and the league takes a stand with great regularity on the side of right  look to coosa valley for industrial progress cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the  northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission coupling its own budget of  with a  state grant authorized by gov vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech then a fulltime planning office will be established in rome to work with a fivemember georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program the undertaking has abundant promise it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an areawide effort better results can be accomplished than through the goitalone approach  rusk idea strengthens united states defense the rusk belief in balanced defense replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that has existed the danger lay not in believing that our own abombs would deter russias use of hers that theory was and is sound the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war it also weakened our diplomatic stance because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start lowgrade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity by maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position  dekalb budget shows county is on beam dekalbs budget for  is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance it includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefedup industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and road maintenance that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by chairman charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed and other county officials  somewhere somebody is bound to love us g mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly touring africa the new us assistant secretary of state observed africa should be for the africans and the british promptly denounced him then he arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying american imperialists go home chin up soapy  power company backs confidence with dollars confidence in the states economic future is reflected in the georgia power companys record construction budget for this year the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization georgias mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a  budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital actually it amounts to  above what the institution already is receiving considering the additional halfmillion dollars gov vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished the work week of attendants who are on duty  hours and more per week should be reduced more attendants nurses and doctors should be hired patients deserve more attention than they are getting even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year georgia will be spending only around  per day per patient the national average is more than  and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low kansas regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill spends  per day per patient georgia has made some reforms true the intensive treatment program is working well but in so many other areas we still are dragging considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted the boost is helpful but inadequate  the end of trujillo assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience rafael trujillo the oftenblood thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for  years perhaps deserved his fate in an evenhanded appraisal of history but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered trujillo knew a great deal about assassination the responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york has been laid at his door he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has been uncovered and quashed the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition el benefactors vanity grew with his personal wealth the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to congress until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character tardily the government here came to understand how this countrys own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression last year after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines trujillos dictatorship had been along conservative rightwing lines but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger the dominican republic could turn toward communisttype authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help start on rapid transit highspeed buses on the george washington memorial parkway operating between downtown washington and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta c darwin stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area because the buses would not stop on the parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress must berlin remain divided the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city so far as the record is concerned the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so though walter ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semicity into the soviet zone the wartime protocol of september   designated a special greater berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint occupation it was not a part of any one of the three later four zones for occupation by soviet american british and french troops respectively after the berlin blockade and airlift the council of foreign ministers in  declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany that this and the closing of the east berlinwest berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain france and the united states sent to moscow after the latters gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile soundtruck taunts of gerhard eisler the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany they insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact there remains of course the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed remembering the stepbystep fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedys representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed prairie national park thousands of buffalo bison they will never be to the man on the street grazing like a mobile brown throwrug upon the rolling dustygreen grassland a horizon even and seamless binding the vast sunbleached dome of sky to earth that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in liveoak canyons near hollywood for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county northeast kansas as a prairie national park there the buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as motheaten zoo specimens wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn as the first settlers saw them the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve whisky on the air a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hardliquor advertising on tv and radio starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking to break down the antiliquor barriers in majormarket stations probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hardliquor commercials past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition why then with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional action simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of noncode competitors although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudosophistication with which tv softdrinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsiecola and gulling him into downing bourbon a law is needed new york democrats choice registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their partys candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization in the central contest that for mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other mayor robert f wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record state controller arthur levitt on the other hand cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the citys welfare they too have links with the citys ills both men are known to be honest and publicspirited mayor wagners shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post as mayor mr levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like his election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the regulars mr wagner might or might not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses these are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party little war big test both mr ks have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos president kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow but at the same time he moved his helicopterborne marines to within an hour of the fighting and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces for mr kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time at his press conference mr kennedy said all we want in laos is peace not war  a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog washington in a tactical mess as wars go laos is an extremely little one casualties have been running about a dozen men a day the hard core of the procommunist rebel force numbers only some  tough viet minh guerrilla fighters but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combattested government army in monsoonshrouded roadshy guerrillathwisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddockagainsttheindians contest it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington fortunately both the republicans and americas chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of  and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a proneutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a ceasefire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers the road to a guaranteedneutral coupproof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nations terrain but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the laotian people who would not be wellruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made the world awaits mr khrushchevs choice of alternatives a vote for educational tv the senates overwhelming  vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die but this year prospects may be better the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds this years senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with  to be used in support of private state or municipal etv efforts the funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value but lacking money from commercial sponsors the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service other communities the ones to be aided most by the senate bill have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment a good man departs goodby mr sam sam rayburn was a good man a good american and third a good democrat he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure mr speaker mr sam and mr democrat at one and the same time the house was his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second most powerful man in washington mr rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label he was no flaming liberal yet the new deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him he was not a rearlooking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once given was not subject to retraction it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical his leadership was not for audiences a growl a nod was usually enough when it was not one of the great dramas of washington would be presented he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence he spoke briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourishes he made good plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them with his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader he was of course in the house for a very long time there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn voted for the declaration of war against germany in  to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house and it was the house he loved to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition the senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president he served with him sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death woodrow wilson with whom he began his years in washington warren g harding calvin coolidge fdr with whom he managed a social revolution and those still with us herbert c hoover harry s truman dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy he was a fighter for those of his own party mr truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of  to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there as it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration with republican presidents he fought fair he was his own man not an automatic obstructionist he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play under any name mr speaker mr democrat mr sam he was a good man un off the congo track thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends in  months no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries in other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it to the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence mass rapes troop mutinies uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrences yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa right now they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga that notion is fantastically wrongheaded from several points of view the un army is too weak too demoralized for the task further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos the congo should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach otherwise un will march blindly on to certain defeat featherbed reversal a recent editorial discussing a labormanagement agreement reached between the southern pacific co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed  hours pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to  per cent per year our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need also normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the lads met in st louis it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there it was the brief writers decided mans best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world peace its wonderful and world law its wonderful too and shouldnt we get an international covenant extending it into space before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon meanwhile in moscow khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to  million tons of tnt to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who cant see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally would certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st louis to the moon where there wouldnt even be any beer to drink while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who cant appreciate coexistence thru suicide fools he bayed what do you think you are doing the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we arent playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old ten oclock shadow the plane was sent back to the united states for a change but castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castros right hand man che guevara who edified the interamerican economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas venezuela the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand to promise latin americans a  billion dollar foreign aid millennium perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests these things would not happen the same can be said about the halfhearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev pass the iron rations please and light another candle for its getting dark down here and were minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away the customer loses again the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car by reducing rates as much as  per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines the boards action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws a shock wave from africa word of dag hammarskjolds death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously it was on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold war issues his firm hand will be desperately missed mr hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace he had sought talks with moise tshombe the secessionist president of congos katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody he earnestly urged a ceasefire the story of the fatal crash is not fully known the unchartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired whether this or overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations most controversial leader he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice he courageously defended the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc the congo in whose cause he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold despite the danger flew to exert a calming influence he gave his life for his beliefs the un session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice that is the hope of mankind monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miamis hardest tasks too many have bogged down in bickering even when public bodies arrived at a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity all nine members of the interamerican center authority voted for goodbody  companys proposal to finance the longawaited trade and cultural center the widely known financial firm has  days to spell out the terms of its contract if the indenture is accepted the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue then goodbody will hand over a minimum of  million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority they allotted  three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged less than half the sum has been spent since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations the balance is being budgeted for the coming year unanimity on interama is not surprising it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of  million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project county officials have cooperated consistently so have the peoples elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels interama as it rises will be a living monument to greater miamis ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises a short report and a good one progress or lack of it toward civil rights in the  states is reported in an impressive page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights much happened in this field during the past  months each state advisory committee documented its own activity some accounts are quite lengthy but floridas is the shortest of all requiring only four paragraphs the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians william d singer and john b turner of miami no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year either verbally or written from any individual or group the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint the progress reported by the advisory committee is real while some think we move too fast and others too slowly floridas record is a good one and stands out among the  west germany remains western west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead on berlin and unification with a coalition government this is the key fact emerging from sundays national election chancellor adenauers christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since  in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength inevitably this means some compromise the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired both willy brandts social democrats who gained  seats in the new parliament and the free democrats who picked up  will insist on that before they enter the government moonfaced ludwig erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him if he becomes chancellor dr erhart would make few changes the wizard who fashioned west germanys astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise he is dedicated to building the nations strength and as are all west germans to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result if the party of adenauer and erhart with  per cent of the vote approaches the party of willy brandt which won  per cent the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve west berlins mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it the free democrats  per cent of the vote believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union and more dealings with the communist bloc the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility it could go either way since the gains for both points of view were about the same regardless of the decision two facts are clear west germany with its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations and the career of konrad adenauer who upheld germanys tradition of rocklike leaders which bismarck began draws near the end better ask before joining americans are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesnt want to make a spectacle of himself for instance socalled conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root one specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anticommunist efforts the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled according to the chicago tribune news service state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name  does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations  does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges  does it put the label of unamerican or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically  does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars communism depression and other troubles of the world  does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns  do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate in some instances a seventh question can be added  does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system if the wouldbe joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time falling somewhere in a category between einsteins theory and sand fleas difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless is the tropical green city of islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future the latter is what concerns us all whatever land you can see here from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward belongs to someone people who have title to the land and what you cant see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too the public the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the abovewater land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected and until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing closed doors in city hall the reaction of certain city council members to californias newest antisecrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public in the preamble to the openmeeting statutes collectively known as the brown act the legislature declares that the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the peoples business it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know the full implementation of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature since  california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act despite the lip service paid by local governments the antisecrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations when all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law and one of its principal aims without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily but the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious help when needed  if the dominican republic achieves free democratic government it will be due in large part to the us show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship outwardly ciudad trujillo is calm none of the trujillo family remains mr balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring had us warships not appeared off the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba within the organization of american states there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillos waterfront shouting vive yankees more the us action was hailed by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future mr balaguers troubles are by no means over he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism protrujillo and procastro alike in cooperating toward that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states  matter of survival  those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in  now as then it is a matter of jobs craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance the issue was sufficiently potent in  to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members that breach was healed  years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations or thats what it looked like at the time but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the aflcio says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as say jimmy hoffa of the teamsters is a matter of conjecture but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craftindustrial rivalry do not win friends for labor engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labors family feuds the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive  deterrent  the army navy and air force among others may question secretary freemans claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by americas capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production or even by the soviets successes in space this shouldnt surprise the secretary american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long long time in fact over the years the american farmers capacity to overproduce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar and thus far mr freeman has offered very little relief the  feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar fiasco in exchange for higher price supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer the result  billion added to the deficit in the federal budget perhaps as mr freeman says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also swindling the american taxpayer  whats wrong at state  a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions the department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen jackson says the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes nor does sen jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates but competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what sen jackson lists as the primary need a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as sen jackson puts it in work that does not really need doing mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jacksons recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved selfcriticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress  betting men  forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends james p mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment didnt drop below three million a couple of years ago he lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora his successor secretary goldberg also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under  per cent for the last  months no betting man mr goldberg says hes merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods mr mitchell had an excuse for losing the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated mr goldberg has less reason for missing the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the  hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they cant be blamed in november the odds thus appear favorable that the secretarys neck may be spared  little resistance  cambodias chief of state who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia but so convinced of communisms inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel i have to see the facts is the way the prince puts it and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a prowestern posture prince sihanouks powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions bottom sighted  commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washingtons economic forecasters weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges appraisal though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales februarys volume was  per cent above januarys for the first pickup since last october although its still  per cent off from february  corroborating mr hodges figures was the federal reserve boards report of the large sales increase in the nations department stores for the week ending march  in newark for example this gain was put at  per cent above the yearearlier level of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in  another optimistic sign this one from the labor department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb  initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by  in the week ending march  mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesnt think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes well we cant have everything prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut  in new jersey too  new jersey folk need not be told of the builders march to the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain now the stone harbor bird sanctuary  acres of magic attraction for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends far beyond our state against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of  miles of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves the move for establishment of a national seashore park on  acres of cape cod from provincetown to chatham is strengthened by president kennedys interest in that area but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country by comparison stone harbor bird sanctuarys allies seem less formidable for aside from the audubon society they are mostly the snowy common and cattle egrets and the louisiana green little blue and blackcrowned herons who nest and feed there but there is hope for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing but that heritage is shrinking even faster  no joyride  much of the glamor president kennedys peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver the head corpsman anybody who is expecting a joyride should according to mr shriver get off the train right now first of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling it will be a hour training day then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different and the pay of course will be nil despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else the study of the st louis areas economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey of  and the easily observed picture of the missouriillinois countryside st louis sits in the center of a relatively slowgrowing and in some places stagnant midcontinent region slackened regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the regions relative lack of purchasing power not all st louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois gov daltons new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a ninestate regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry that is one approach another would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis president of the university of missouri and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouris economy he says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy  the research center of the universitys school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr ellis has been talking about he and dean john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference the university can make a valuable contribution to the states economic development through such a study in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth the carbondale industrial development corp has obtained a  loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a cityowned factory to accommodate production that will provide  new jobs carbondale is in the herrinmurphysborowest frankfort labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouris depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit st louis as well  politicsridden st clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development more industrial acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st louis area the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side and then there is st louis county where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth st louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over areawide interests some plantlocation specialists take these signs to mean st louis county doesnt want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost metropolitan st louiss relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi without a great acceleration in the metropolitan areas economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st louis will slip into secondclass status an excess of zeal many of our very best friends are reformers still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far take for example the reformers among new york citys democrats having whipped mr de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall they have changed the name to chatham hall even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building do they believe that they can make the new name stick granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name after all it goes back to the days in which sedition was not unamerican the days in which the sons of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence the british government that is further do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo they will when they give up the donkey and the elephant instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tigers stripes are not black that might go over the faget case the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official col mariano faget from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds the kennedy administration had assured anticastro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro moreover col fagets information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening castro agents the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power and while he had headed batistas anticommunist section the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service gen swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office his official term expired last summer some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get congressman walter has been allpowerful in immigration matters but he has announced plans to retire in  at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen swing the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat mr eisenhower politician as president dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics as a former president however mr eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally and generally missed his target mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon this was juvenile ridicule nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit finally mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington this statement recalls the  berlin crisis when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded expresidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words some of former president trumans offthecuff discourses have been in that vein nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility this is a matter of respect for the presidency mr eisenhowers new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship queen of the seas the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high seas reports that the venerable liner which has been in service since  was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us but the cunard line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least a new queen with the prosaic title of q had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary the british government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling  toward the  cost of a new ton passenger liner since  more and more transatlantic passengers have been crossing by air economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines competition from other steamship lines has cut cunards share of sea passengers from onethird to onefourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than  tons this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation mission to viet nam gen maxwell taylors statement in saigon that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the prowestern government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army gen taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military economic political and other resources there was good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis south viet nams rice surplus for next year more than  tons may have been destroyed the viet cong the communist rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november nothing that is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in  when gen ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of  to  divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing it is a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops he may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming south viet nam has received  in united states aid since  and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnsons visit last may gen taylor the presidents special military adviser is a levelheaded officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass gov john m dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained not because of their legal talents but because of their government influence the u ns gravest crisis ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u ns problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the institution has faced of course it is if the decision goes wrong it may be as mr stevenson fears the first step on the slippery path downhill to a u n without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the organization in other words the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one he should be as dag hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the world the charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible the united states and its allies have had no objection to this what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjolds death to turn the entire u n staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly around the nature of his relationship with them although the united states and the u s s r have been arguing whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary generals decisions the nature of the organization will have changed if they give him advice when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction the nature of the u n will not of necessity change the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone elses instructions this is the root issue for which the united states should stand we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography what we must have if the united nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject to no single nations direction and subservient to no single nations ambition what the new charter does the new city charter which should get a yes vote as question no  on nov  would not make a good mayor out of a bad one there is no such magic in manmade laws but it would greatly strengthen any mayors executive powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate increase his budgetmaking authority both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor thus there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative the board is diminished in both respects while it retains control over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment of property and other trusteeship functions the board will be able to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the mayors veto but the city council will now share fully this budgetaltering power overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council and a twothirds vote the controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed he loses nowmisplaced tax collection duties which go to the finance department on net balance in spite of controller gerosas opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now borough presidents while retaining membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions highways go to a new department of highways sewers to the department of public works such street cleaning as borough presidents now do in queens and richmond to the sanitation department some fiscal changes are important the expense operating budget is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy with the mayor approving in fund transfers within a department the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises but as a secondlook safeguard each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business it will also correct some injustices enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow interamerican press the interamerican press association which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years the i a p a is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime more and more cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced into exile the i a p a found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batistas dictatorship began in  freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances in such conditions all freedoms are lost this in more diplomatic language is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government he felt able to end on a note of hope he sees evidence of fair winds for the tenyear alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the interamerican press association meeting in moscow the twentysecond soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced according to the original program premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage depending upon individual or national politics because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by  the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russias progress painted by the communist partys program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchevs berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered whether it is or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for  they and their children must first survive this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job dr conants call to action dr james b conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change now a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york has shattered this optimism dr conant has come away shocked and angry his new book entitled slums and suburbs calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr conants specific views his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open or permissive enrollment dr conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend but these are side issues to a powerful central theme that theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and doubletalk it labels the slums especially the negro slums as deadend streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike the facts he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of the color of their students a call for action before it is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who in his previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme measures these warnings must not be treated lightly dr conants conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nations gratitude he has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools and now more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive socalled junk mail he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses or even zone numbers in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district this means an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis  our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly typewritten most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery she had she said heard that the plant was closing it couldnt close she said she had raised a calf grown it beeffat she had with her own workweary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud blossom and get ready to bear she was ready to kill the beef dress it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth hash and stew against the winter she had done it last year and the year before and the year before that and she and her people were dependent upon these cans for food this did not happen in counties of north georgia where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land nor in south georgia where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields this happened in decatur dekalb county not  miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta and now the woman tired and trembling came here to the dekalb county cannery is it so the cannery is going to close o n moss  tall grey as a possum canning plant chief since  didnt know what to say he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer he did say he was out of cans the no s but i requisitioned  he said he had no s enough to last two weeks more threat of closing the cannery is a recent one a threeman committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed reason the cannery loses  yearly but dekalb citizens those who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed to make any money the cannery said mrs lewellyn lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of  to handle the victory garden produce is a service to the taxpayer and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant grow vegetables and put them up it helps those people who help themselves the county though seems more interested in those people who dont even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food a driver of a dairy truck who begins work at  am finishes before breakfast then goes out and grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five asked what in the world will we do what in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes the tomatoes will any of us do moss a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county doesnt believe it will close but he is in the middle an employe of dekalb but on the side of the people the young married people the old couples the dairy truck driver the old woman with the stew dont ask me if i think the cannery helps he said sir i know the cannery helps most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it there is one thing i know a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades several years ago i was his pastor one night at the close of the evening service he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land we tried to settle this dispute he said but could never come to an agreement i settled it tonight he continued i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in your heart henry van dyke said forgive and forget if you can but forgive anyway jesus made three things clear about forgiveness we must first of all be willing to forgive others before we can secure gods forgiveness for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses matthew  it will do no good to seek gods forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong then jesus indicated that gods forgiveness is unlimited in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words forgive us our debts when a person meets gods requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven gods mercy and patience will last forever forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by gods love it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past we want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future finally we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us once peter asked how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven matthew  jesus not only taught forgiveness he gave us an example of it on the cross with all the energy of his broken body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what they do luke  shes been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although shes still a teenager who looks like a baby she is getting married her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish said for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldnt have made myself heard if id had the equivalent of the message to garcia but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female six girls sprawled on one bed drinking cokes and giggling she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute how do you know you love somebody enough to get married she asked it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure arent you sure i asked looking at her searchingly i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important but if she were just having a normal case of prenuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage besides in all honesty i dont know how you can be sure i dont know any secret recipe for certainty in the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth does he ever bore you i asked bore me she was shocked oh noo why hes so darling and  i mean i went on ruthlessly when hes not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love is he interesting does he care about things that matter to you can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating because honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage long periods when youre hopelessly stranded together and if you bore each other then heaven help you she came back the other day to reassure me she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting she asked if i had other advice and heady with success i rushed it in i hope not too late be friends with your motherinlaw jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothersinlaw make good friends i do not know dr wilson sneed well but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st lukes church in atlanta it was the cry of not just one heart it spoke for many in the clergy i suspect the pulpit is a lonely place who stops to think of that imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments he told his members a minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote  for he becomes ordinary    and so the young minister resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he told his parishioners when i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self but oh how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards  yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word and gods we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week american cash if we break the minister to our bit we are buying back our own sins if he wont break we add to the stress he bears and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to we expect him to be noble and to make us so yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be we expect bestowal of gods love through him but how little love we give him the church truly is not a rest home for saints but a hospital for sinners yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers too mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure the evening was not always spent in the same way this year on a night cool with the front of september moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages in the midst of it all mr podger came out on the pod porch alone he had that day attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize the prize was an oldfashioned woven cloth hammock complete with crosstop pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging mrs podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was slung in a vineshaded corner the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement mr podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him suddenly one young voice rose above the others but it said do you always know when youre happy the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question stayed in mr podgers mind here in the cool autumntouched evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace  it had begun with the blue jay feather walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight the winging spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet all day long mr podger who was a strawhat man in the summer had worn the feather in the band of his broadbrimmed sunshield would a blue feather in a mans hat make him happy all day hardly but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake then since the auction was being held nearby he had walked to it and there on the way had been the box turtle that slow selfcontained worldignoring relic of prehistory bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road it was doing very well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car would the driver see the turtle would he take pains to avoid it mr podger took no chances taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its roadcrossing with what must have been a breathtaking suddenness the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon but mr podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other here in the cool darkness mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sunbrowned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight where was the driver now what was he doing and the turtle mr podger smiled for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama the three would never meet again but for some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember the incident then there had been the auction itself mr podger heard again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr podgers hammock purchase i like them things too he had said we got one at home you know what if youre lyin out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool you know you just take these sides with the fringe on see and wrap em right over you i do it lots o times i like to lie in a hammock at night by myself when its all quiet  the wind moves it a little bit you know   mr podger had thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon mr podger saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that the boy too was lying in a cool fringedwrapped quiet alacrity the podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly and mr podger took her inside the fringe soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod mr podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out dad she said its getting so chilly weve lighted a fire and were going to tell a round robin story a nice scary one we need you to start it why are you out here all by yourself arent you happy mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire of course i am he said never happier in my life i just came out here to know it dallas as the south begins another school year national and even world attention is directed at the regions slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities dallas and atlanta in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully the programs do not take sides on the issue itself they point out simply that it is the law of the land the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation even better they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs in each case there was an initial act of violence in nashville a school was dynamited in houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes none of which were serious in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents the nashville plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south it is a stairstep plan in which desegregation begins in the first grade each year another grade is added to the process until finally all  grades are integrated the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why not now the program has worked well in both nashville and houston it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program generally throughout the south there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas during the summer negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments it was part of a citywide move toward full integration so successful has been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that further extensions are expected in the next few months hotels for example are ready to let down the bars already at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously allwhite neighborhoods of dallas it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it there are many causes for this change one of the most important is economic business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of cooperation has sprung up this cooperation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation they realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation economic and otherwise since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago ive been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship played mostly on the freeways around los angeles it goes like this a driver cruising easily at  mph in lane a of a fourlane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b which is heavily populated by cars also moving at  mph the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him he can  point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a  slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes or  alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access whether or not this is done out of enlightened selfpreservation i dont know but it is done consistently and im both surprised and impressed  this could never happen in my native chicago there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood in chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back failing this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however does an injustice to southern california drivers at the risk of losing my chargeaplate at marshall field and company i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype after three months of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers ive ever encountered during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street miami fla march  an outoftown writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year now richards of course is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go he can often make the complex ridiculously simple and vice versa this happened to be vice versa but even so the answer was a masterpiece its a whole lot easier he said to increase the population of nevada than it is to increase the population of new york city and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote said the writer scratching his head now if i can just figure out what hes talking about ill use it two spots open this was just richards way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two spots left and right field are really up for grabs it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year but so far it hasnt worked that way this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one youd never guess it from the way theyve played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in  obviously if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement someplace where can that improvement possibly come from you certainly cant expect the infield to do any better than it did last year robby could be better brooks robinson is great and it is conceivable that hell do even better in  than he did in  you cant expect it though robbys performance last year was tremendous its the same with ron hansen and jim gentile if they do as well as they did in  there can be no complaint they shouldnt be asked to carry any more of the burden hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might very well set him back he got off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstances probably wont duplicate it there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year they dont expect to stop him just slow him down some with the bat hell still be a top player they concede because hes got a great glove and the long ball going for him but they expect to reduce his overall offensive production breeding might move up gentile can hardly do better than drive in  runs dont ask him more i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch but even so he had a good year in  and wont do too much better so all in all the infield cant be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first and the pitching will also have trouble doing better richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season where then can we look for improvement from triandos brandt and walker answers richards theyre the ones we can expect to do better the man is right and at this time indications are that these three are ready for better seasons triandos hasnt proved it yet but he says hes convinced his thumb is all right he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasnt bothered him if he can bounce back with one of those  home runs years the club will have to be better off offensively im still not convinced though ill have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him hank foiles backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant to me brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year he hasnt played too much because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice hes hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year when he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club he was down hard to talk to and far too nonchalant on the field as of now that all seems behind him hes been entirely different all spring and walker looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year let him bounce back and he could really set up the staff so if the orioles are to improve brandt triandos and walker will have to do it so far the platoons on left and right fielders dont seem capable of carrying the load of course this isnt taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city but its the way things look from here at this point is the mother of an autistic child at fault the autistic child is one who seems to lack a welldefined sense of self he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people did his mother make him this way some people believe she did we think differently we believe that autism like so many other conditions of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties sometimes she can to a large extent help him overcome them but we dont think she creates them we dont think she can make her child defective emotionally disturbed or autistic the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written for the layman wed like to share one experienced mothers comments she wrote total disinterest as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything i have to manipulate my sons fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy he wants me to do everything for him you dont believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them but i do and my psychiatrist does too i know that my son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned this is that autistic people dont enjoy physical contact with others for instance my children and i when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board he pushes and straightens himself as if he cant stand the feeling of being held physical contact is uncomforatble for him this mother is quite correct as a rule the autistic child doesnt enjoy physical contact with others parents have to find other ways of comforting him for the young child this may be no more than providing food light or movement as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object his magic thing or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick the answer is different for each autistic child but for most there is an answer only ingenuity will uncover it what future holds dear doctors we learned this year that our older son daniel is autistic we did not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to fortunately there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group of normal children i try to treat daniel as if he were normal though of course i realize he is far from that at present what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible what is your experience with autistic children how do they turn out later many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood singlecolor use question  a first grader colors pictures one solid color everything sky grass boy wagon etc when different colors are used she is

things should be colored she is an aggressive nervous child is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits answer  her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade no coloring isnt exactly something you teach a child you sometimes give them a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to replace the onecolor look to which we have been accustomed just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme so may some of the newest versions of embroidery one such in fact is a rug though not actually crewel embroidery it has that look with its overstitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a sauterne background the twirled stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country the work is executed in england by hand and can be

candidatepicking conventions in the states  new congressional districts at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox yearold amateur politico thomas b carvey jr whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircrafts moon missiles hes approached his democratic duties in hardnosed engineering fashion  viewed from afar the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups  or so much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every volunteer democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the cdc  moreover the entire state democratic hierarchy from gov brown on down to the county chairmen also participates in this huge operation contrarily republican volunteers go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication that theyd be willing to join forces under a single directorate except in the most looseknit fashion carvey believes that reapportionment which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries actually will increase cdc membership where only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up cdc units in rockribbed democratic territory paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register  and to in the partys favor strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis like most democratic spokesmen carvey predicts  will be a tremendously partisan year hence the attention theyre lavishing on the cdc in all probability the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these preprimary favorites this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who dont see eyetoeye with the cdc naturally the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f kennedy last year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign the cdc plainly intends to provide the partys campaign muscle in  there is evidence that it will be happily received by gov brown and the other constitutional incumbents  carvey considers that former vice president nixon

sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred

come as certainly as the peace treaty whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn in kennedys speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the presidents advisers and the political and economic forces behind them well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war over west berlin moscow tass in russian datelined sochi chairman khrushchev received the us presidents disarmament adviser john

promised upon grabbing power and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards chairman khrushchev kennedy rattles his rockets sabre in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position his advisers in the politburo white house are engaged in a great struggle of opinions so he is not always consistent the soviet union will fight neither a

brief suspensions in publication this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c atkinson and charles alexander who had just taken over franklins old paper desired a more distinctive name when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays in the middle of the century with a circulation of  the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in  cyrus h k curtis purchased it paper type and all for  it was a page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed

first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english since it was issued in the spring of  the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible however biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in  as the english revised version and in  as the american standard version then in  americas international council of religious education authorized a new revision in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages undertaken by  american scholars under the chairmanship of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university divinity school their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version  not rival the new english bible the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship time of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose bible reading even more so than good classical music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james version however an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars one is impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language than in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james for example in the third chapter of matthew verses  describing the baptism of jesus the  version reads then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him clearer meaning certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings in the new english bible which reads then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee and he came to john to be baptized by him john tried to dissuade him do you come to me he said i need rather to be baptized by you jesus replied let it be so for the present we do well to conform this way with all that god requires john then allowed him to come after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven opened he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him the paragraphing spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount to illustrate the first blessing in the king james bible reads blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven the new version states how blest are those who know that they are poor the kingdom of heaven is theirs some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar to a novice that is significant in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains however the old phrase angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop this is not contemporary english mostly contemporary for the most part however the new version is contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ originally recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated and retranslated through the ages discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy of the bible to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth there is one danger however with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic the only answer will be continuous study the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england church of scotland methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian church of england churches in wales churches in ireland society of friends british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland prof c h dodd  a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new testament is general

their teeth properly several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly bedfast with a chronic

experiences of the feverish fifties one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows which gave him inferiority complexes though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent wellinformed american but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a  profit on the stock market every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bullseye achievements the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it his answer was simple but honest he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bullseye one of the obstacles to the easy control of a yearold child is a lack of verbal communication the child understands no he senses his mothers disapproval but explanations leave him confused and unmoved if his mother loves him he clings to that love as a ballast it motivates his behavior he wants mommy to think him a good boy he doesnt want her to look frowningly at him or speak to him angrily this breaks his heart he wants to be called sweet good considerate and mothers little helper but even mothers loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mothers love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them his own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed it wont develop until he has words with which to clothe it the conscience is nonexistent in the yearold what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior she can decrease the number of temptations she can remove all knickknacks within reach the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child if he cant play with mommys magazines he should have some old numbers of his own if daddys books are out of bounds his own picture books are not toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the childs conscience she tells him of the consequences of his behavior if he bites a playmate she says danny wont like you if he snatches a toy she says caroline wants her own truck just as you do there is no use trying to explain to a yearold actions speak louder remove temptations remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act he wont submit to his natural desires all the time and its mothers love that is responsible for his good behavior this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call homecoming day they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes the football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperors lions it is true of course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and then the christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team even with all possible precaution homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them more often than not as the old grad wanders along the old paths his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the aroma of autumn fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat usually they titter loudly after they have passed by his dream goes he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous his bifocals blur his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth it is not much better if he meets with old classmates too often unless he hails them they pass him by he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said on returning from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didnt even recognize him if they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace the moment soon is done after all when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie  when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live  when questions are asked and answered about families and children and old professors  when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted  that does it middleaged spread by then one begins to notice the middleage spread the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin or too heavy the fading signs of old beauty the athlete of bygone years who wears a size  suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length  then it is time to break it up and move on it is if anything worse on the old player  he sits in the stands and he doesnt like that enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd he always feels lonely a team feels something on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about him he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped the churning of straining feet the rasp of the canvas pants the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his face he remembers the desperate panting breath the long runs on the kickoffs the hard jolting tackles the breakthrough the desperate agony of goalline stands and so he squirms with each play remembering his youth but it is no use it is gone no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength they can never be recaptured again since the obvious is not always true the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred as suspected in the larger cities of  cities with populations of  and more mr kennedy carried  and mr nixon  there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election these are new york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois and minnesota in  mr eisenhower won all but missouri yet in  all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia mr nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed to do so his visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey in the summer of  was expected to win the polish vote which in several cities is substantial yet the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr nixon received but  per cent of the socalled polish vote  per cent of the irish vote and  per cent of the negro vote task force a gop task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be a statistical one and not a reality the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working parttime do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics which the gop declared it to be the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery senator mundts gross distortion of president eisenhowers conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr eisenhower declared to be entirely false is another case in point if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities errors repeated the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt goldwater bridges dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the s in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr hoover and the partys failure to anticipate or cope with the depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash the republican party was not lacking in humanity but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble farmers called their muledrawn pickup trucks hoover carts smokers reduced to the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as hoover dust one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasnt meant to repeat this error but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f kennedy that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that  per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nations business the most articulate republicans are those who in their desire to get back at mr kennedy already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care if they also defeat the school bill the gop task force wont have much research to do it will early know why the party wont win back city votes the  general assembly has important business to consider the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner after the griffinbyrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a prelegislative forum this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions hopedfor legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a selfinsurance system for the state in the midst of a governors race how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt gov garland byrds senate committee on government operations the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governors race forward a few months causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual but when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november the situation was aggravated neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation to have refused would have been political suicide and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast aside the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious candidates but state party chairman james gray of albany said no and he didnt mince any words they are just asking too much he said we cant think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates either there are other dangers politics is an accelerating game if an opponent accuses you of lying dont deny it say he is a horse thief runs an old adage these men are spenders if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where the promises would end griffins rural roads authority and byrds  miles of county contracts would look like paupers oaths the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one why not have them travel the state in november debating it would present a forum for them in almost every community but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governors race being run in the next legislature the spectre of big spending programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin there isa way out of this the chamber has not arranged a prelegislative forum it has arranged a campaign for governor if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates it can provide a service to the state but the legislature should be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing up sides for the race former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was not a great soldier ikes somewhat like george washington both won a pretty fairsized war with a modest assist from british strategy congressmen returning from recess say the people admire president kennedy so much theyre even willing to heed his call to sacrifice and give up his program slogan of the john birch society paddle your own canoe the guy who makes the motor boats may be a communist a republican survey says kennedy won the  election on the religious issue too many people were afraid if the gop won theyd have to spend all their time praying the providence journal editorial jan  entitled east greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours your suggested solution it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the welltodo could afford to buy land and build in the new sites what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs bostitch inc is approximately half way through a year exemption of their real estate tax the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory the  tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars with our current  per hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow mr richard preston executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october   warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said if this is the fundamental reason for a communitys interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain he went on to say in the first place industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life the fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called for example  the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessetteast greenwichpotowomut area of the two communities  the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich  the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent county memorial hospital a regional facility  the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment  feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich  east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves  the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny  i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund it is indeed true as stated in the famous novel of our day for whom the bell tolls that no man is an island entirely of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main thanks to the generosity of mr irving j fain president of the temple beth el rev dewitt clemens pastor of the mathewson street methodist church mr felix miranda of the imperial knife co and to mrs rozella switzer regional director of the national conference of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund it is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful and good bless you my friends for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality  i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school my future plans are to become a language teacher of course having this desire i am very interested in education a few weeks ago i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston the article also said that a person had to be  years old or over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade i wish you could see the situation as i see it if russian pupils have to take these languages how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many exceptions i do not think that america is like russia not in the least i am proud of my country the small city i live in my wonderful parents my friends and my school but i am also a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students well there lies your answer  at the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency however the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time many thanks for a job well done  the providence sunday journal article jan  asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have nonserviceconnected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of serviceconnected and nonserviceconnected disabled veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service it can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as nonservice cases later qualify as serviceconnected no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the nonserviceconnected case seem to be coldly impractical and outofstep with the wishes of the general public i believe in priority for serviceconnected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals but i dont believe we should close the door on nonserviceconnected patients this matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long theres a reason for this length of stay first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient he has no experience with this veterans previous medical record if the doctor is conscientious he wants to study the patient as a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient secondly the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any  state hospitals  it seems that open season upon veterans hospitalization is once more upon us the american medical association is once again grinding out its tearsoaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer do they the ama offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama on the health problem confronting the aged they opposed the forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars matched incidentally by a federal grant to initiate a lousy job chicago aug   no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even panic this we can sympathetically understand but no president ever before referred to his as a lousy job as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen barry goldwater during his aggressive campaign to win his present position mr kennedy was vitriolic about this countrys prestige abroad what does he think a remark like this lousy one does to our prestige and morale if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a lousy job then heaven help us all  questions shelters evansville ind aug   defense secretary robert s mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about  million dollars why should congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least  miles in diameter this sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization  short shorts on the campus chicago aug   it seems college isnt what it should be i refer to the attire worn by the students upon a visit to a local junior college last week i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years education should be uppermost in their minds but with this attire how can anyone think it is so it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students many high school students go past my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen no matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts  masaryk award chicago aug   the granting of the jan masaryk award august  to senator paul douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed masaryk and against principles masaryk died to uphold douglas has voted for aid to communists and for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid etc  subsidies from cta oak park aug   in todays voice the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should the welfare of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community not only of that part of it that rides the cta cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children policemen and firemen  marketing meat chicago aug   in reply to a letter in todays voice urging the sale of meat after  p m i wish to state the other side of the story i am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market my husbands hours away from home for the past years have been from  a m to  p m the early part of the week and as late as  or  on weekends now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings and sundays too for this is coming there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying stores where meat cutters will not be required if a customer wishes a special cut it will not be available we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week on weekends when prices are lower also many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them independent market owners work six days a week and my husband hasnt had a vacation in  years no we are not greedy but if we closed the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block the meat cutters union which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets what it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice of cut being made by the consumer not the store  the legion convention and sidney holzman chicago aug   i too congratulate the american legion of which i am proud to have been a member for more than  years on the recent state convention i regret that bertha madeira todays voice obtained incorrect information had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and without an amendment to the law we could not enforce this my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises and not by innuendo criticize them at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties  teaching the handicapped chicago aug   the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field the illinois commission for handicapped children which for  years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois and of promoting more adequate services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children  from candlelight club minneapolis aug   i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed your june  article on liberace and to thank you for it please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person  more school less pay chicago aug   is this perhaps one of the things that is wrong with our country engineering graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the schools history  a month my son who has completed two years in engineering school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer at a rate of  an hour he is now earning approximately  a month ironic is it not that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer  the dupont case editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page washington aug   your july  editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective tax relief for du pont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact as a result your criticism of attorney general robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate unwarranted and unfair the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on du pont stockholders in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that du pont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that du pont stockholders might have to pay from an estimated  billion dollars under present law to as little as  million dollars congressman wilbur d mills chairman of the house ways and means committee asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to antitrust law enforcement the attorney general responded by letter dated july  copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public in this letter mr kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration what effect the legislative proposals might have on future antitrust judgments there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress not the department of justice to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation yet your editorial said now the attorney general writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion what mr kennedy in fact wrote was it is the departments view that no antitrust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion the editorial by omitting the words antitrust enforcement totally distorted mr kennedys views the headline is offensive particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial  congresswoman church wilmette aug   i concur most heartily with todays letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen and sen douglas but when you write to congresswoman church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely should she disagree she explains why in detail when she agrees you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged i think we have the hardest working best representative in congress harmful drinks downers grove aug   a recent news story reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed  airplane passengers  minutes in london while they finished their drinks they do our country great harm by such actions those in

overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nations main industries in covert socialism toward which america is moving private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them in order to attract new industries  states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise this is a step toward overt socialism issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions workers of the party to the editor sir

employes to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation we therefore considered the suggestion an insult to our intelligence ethics bill of rights etc our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion for the person we feel is capable in directing the public this is our duty not as nurses or city employes but as citizens of the united states  plusone shelters to the editor sir i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves but ready to demand that the community help and protect them community shelters are of course necessary for those having no space for shelter if in a town of  private homes half of them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that homes occupants plusone so he will be able to take in a stranger i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of our plusone shelter club  escape to the editor sir people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space its simple enough from my point of view i am for it it is the only method left for a man to escape from a womans world  supports katanga to the editor sir when the colonies decided upon freedom from england we insisted through the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity it is high time the united states began to realize that the godgiven rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga in the united nations charter the right of selfdetermination is also an essential principle this again applies to katanga the people of katanga had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga and his cohorts by political economic geographic and natural standards they were justified in doing so the united states and the un denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of selfdetermination of the katangans  county college costs to the editor sir permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed none will be elected the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college since two of these could be trustees of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue this is taxation without representation  taxing improvements to the editor sir your editorial housing speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers will happen our entire economy will have a terrific uplift  natural causes to the editor sir an old man is kicked to death by muggers the medical examiner states that death was due to natural causes i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york it is listed as death due to natural causes  praises exhibit to the editor sir every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit our changing skyline in newark it will be at the museum until march  it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects plans models and pictures it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit  parkway courtesy to the editor sir i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere one even gave my little dog a biscuit it was very refreshing  deep peep show the viewers of the deep peep show at th and m streets nw have an added attraction the view of a fossilized cypress swamp twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black coallike deposit has been encountered this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypresslike trees were growing the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay some of the stumps are as much as three feet long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments although the wood has been changed to coal much of it still retains its original cell structure in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time these microfossils indicate the swamp was formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing the th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on th street reported in the washington post august   which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger  working for peace recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points that i would like to question  he said lets work for peace instead of protection from aggression i would ask why not do both military power does not cause war war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people are we not late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough about this lack of understanding  as to protection the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone is this a reason for saving no one would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone  the speaker suggested that the desolation of a postattack world would be too awful to face if the world comes to this wouldnt it be the very time when courage and american knowhow would be needed to help survivors rebuild many of our young people think it would  lastly the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian defense in  public law  created civil defense different from civiliangroups of world war ii a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or manmade far from creating fear as the speaker suggests preparedness knowing what to do in an emergency gives people confidence civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster storm flood accident or even war  pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someones apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide in addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash i grant that the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments  sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists comfort perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season as an added suggestion to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument it is visible throughout the city and men from madison ave would jump at the chance   sen hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart he like most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens let us like the french have outdoor cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd  dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee may  by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work for a neutral germany  soviets said to fear resurgence of german militarism  to the editor of the new york times for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations recent statements by wellknown scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fallouts should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations president kennedy was right when he said we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate i have just returned from a sevenweek trip to europe and the far east it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war the fact is that the italians french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs we have no right to criticize them as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated probable agreement the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse actually the communists out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u n if the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival which has many facets why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world  meeting u n obligations to the editor of the new york times in your editorial of sept  the smoldering congo you make the following comment far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments it is up to the assembly to take action against them they are violating their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations article  section  the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization section  the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly article  a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years the u s s r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget but they refuse as do the arab states to support the united nations expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel and the u n troops in the congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations but by a special budget according to the official interpretation of the charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the special united nations budgets and of course cannot be expelled from the organization which you suggested in your editorial due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion  to aid international law  connally amendments repeal held step toward world order  to the editor of the new york times in your sept  editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eightyseventh congress you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this countrys domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice the connally amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from using the court effectively yet although the kennedy administration and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken our destiny in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace with justice under law to achieve this destiny acts as well as words are needed not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our selfjudging attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eightyseventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment  for better subway services to the editor of the new york times many homebound subway riders utilizing the flushingmain street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventyfourth street and change for the ind this takes a daily toll of time and temper the transit authority has recently placed in operation hold lights at bmt thirtyninth and fiftyninth street stations in brooklyn this holds the local until the express passengers change trains without question this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station  phone service criticized to the editor of the new york times as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly from three to four hours a day in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing however there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing persontoperson calls special longdistance calls etc either it is lack of training lack of proper screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company which does have a governmentblessed monopoly fairpriced funeral to the editor i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be governmentcontrolled the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price far less than i had expected to pay but the hospitals and doctors should be  helping retarded children to the editor recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children hazel park donates its recreation center five days a week to the school there is no charge and no state aid kiwanis american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support there are  children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass they make beautiful objects enough trading stamps were collected to buy a passenger station wagon southfield schools furnish an old passenger bus the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat the school is located at  mile road woodward heights visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do  jobs for cavanagh to the editor i was surprised at mayor mirianis defeat but perhaps mayorelect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare dpw and sanitation negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out educate the city employes to give real service to the public after all they are paid by the public they should be examples  church finds news features are helpful to the editor at a recent meeting of the womens association of the trumbull ave united presbyterian church considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration the daily prayer and three minutes a day as being very helpful we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines  rude youngsters to the editor thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence how old do you have to be to remember when americans especially children were encouraged to be polite why has this form of gentility gone out of american life how can we oldfashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern parents they have observed from necessity they are also inspired by the hardsell attitude of the sponsor so finally it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising  dunes park advocate to the editor i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area ghost town to the editor of the inquirer i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles we have now a quiet city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping in center city good for mr trimmer maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town  defends big trucks to the editor of the inquirer i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldnt be an expressway without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future mr george hough oct  sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop the trucks today help pay for this highway they try to keep within the speed limits although todays trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road  out of school at  to the editor of the inquirer the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at  should have signed his letter simpleton instead of simplicitude such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for the dropouts what we need is more vocational training in high schools not more dropouts  two wrongs to the editor of the inquirer i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children if an atom bomb in  could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have at least the bombs can inflict all the demage that is necessary why do we need bigger and better bombs i repeat two wrongs do not make a right  we tremble not to the editor of the inquirer everyone should take time to read martin luthers hymn a mighty fortress is our god especially the first half of the third verse   out of the race to the editor of the inquirer to our everlasting shame we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race are we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be our master and destroy us  why trust jagan to the editor of the inquirer just because cheddi jagan new boss of british guiana was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isnt a red we have quite a few homegrown specimens of our own if we go all gooey over this newest castro until he proves he isnt weve got rocks in our heads how many times must we get burned before we learn  russia and un to the editor of the inquirer just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london or pearl harbor that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world why arent the soviets expelled from the un  belated tribute to the editor of the inquirer while better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task according to one report however mr hammarskjold was considered too controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring actually of course that label controversial applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union at khrushchevs door therefore can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy  people to people to the editor of the inquirer just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a firstclass example of people to people good will if only this could be done more often with such heartening results many of the earths big problems would shrink to the insignificances they really are p s thanks for your good coverage of ahmads visit too  expressway answer east river drive to the editor of the inquirer your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice they start on the east side of the schuylkill have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination bridges tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings each one of these is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion we should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep ars starting and ending on the east side of the river on the east side this can be accomplished by several logical steps  widen the east river drive at least one lane  so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems  paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent  this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive  shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square  take away george washingtons statue  replace it with the statue of one or another of the worlds famous dictators theres no sense in being reminded of times that were washington square seems not part of a free land it may remind one of russia china or east berlin but it cant remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but its a very good start on the road to totalitarianism  the commission has posted signs in washington square saying the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square fairmount park commission does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance if birds dont belong in a square or park what does they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature the trees are their homes but the commission does not share such sentiments the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds starlings and blackbirds are scared off by cannon from city hall just a preliminary measure if any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too the city government is not united in an allout tothedeath drive to stamp out gangs delinquents thugs murderers rapists subversives indeed no let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive of course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because were afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say how come whats your motive who wants this deed done in this small way do the leaders of a city or of a nation iniure the masses to watching or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music but one let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn abide with me we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what the birds would ask   not pushups but standups to the editor of the inquirer there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too soft unfortunately those who would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft ashamed of our wealth and power afraid of socalled world opinion and addicted to peace we have allowed our softheartedness to lead to softheaded policies when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit selfdetermination when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no longer be soft america doesnt need to pushup she needs to stand up  disputes stans column business scandal views to the editor the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit however he states unequivocally the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor i must in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the socalled scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrumgriffin act escalation unto death the nuclear war is already being fought except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets not yet it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories they predicted escalation and escalation is what we are getting the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some  megatons although our bs are said to be carrying two megaton bombs apiece some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them he seems to have at least a few  and megaton bombs on hand since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock and now of course the hue and cry for counterescalation is being raised on our side khrushchev threatens us with a megaton bomb so be it then we must embark on a crash program for megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds what is needed philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun october  is a discontinuity the escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison writes the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers europe of course must be written off out of hand he feels therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing in the atmosphere on the greatest possible scale all in the name of national security escalation is their first love and their last they will be faithful unto death capable as their minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nations security are incapable of learning or even of observing if this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation he has gained only one thing he has exploded a megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges but if his purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another it is only natural thus when the russians sent up their first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly the tide turns when east germans fled to the west by the thousands paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists they are less vocal now when it is the west berliners who are migrating the flood is not as great only  a week according to one apparently conservative account but it is symptomatic west berlin morale is low and in age distribution the situation is unfavorable nearly  per cent of west berlins  residents are sixtyfive or older only  per cent are under fifteen r h s crossman mp writing in the manchester guardian states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of  but of  a week and applications to leave have risen to  a week the official statistics show that  per cent are employed workers or independent professional people whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by  arrivals each week from west germany but the hard truth says crossman is that the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow the gallant halfcity is dying on its feet another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer london mark arnoldfoster writes people are leaving west berlin because they think it is dying they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months frontline work in factories in west berlin berlins resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed the handwriting is on the wall the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort will not avail tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful the materials for compromise are at hand the nation walter lippmann and other sober commentators see alan clark on p  have spelled them out again and again a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph but it will save berlin or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence if that is what the west wants vacancy the removal of stalins body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history it is in fact a relatively mild chastisement of the dead a british writer richard haestier in a book dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry iv who had died nearly  years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob and in england after the restoration the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows contemplating these posthumous punishments stalin should not lose all hope in  parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing whitehall and there presumably he still stands nikita khrushchev however has created yet another problem for himself the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow is a crowded city and the creed of communism deplores waste who will take stalins place beside lenin there is karl marx of course buried in london the macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has been dead seventyeight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable who then is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin who but nikita himself since he has just shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people besides he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations seems to match that of life suppose he did lie beside lenin would it be permanent if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession when a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand u thant of burma the appointment of u thant of burma as the uns acting secretary general at this writing the choice appears to be certain offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running but france didnt like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr hammarskjold u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy in all the bitter infighting the squabbles over election procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries theme the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat he has moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future he is a buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung u thant of course will hold office until the spring of  when mr hammarskjolds term would have come to an end whether the compromises on both sides that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen mr khrushchevs demand for a troika is dormant not dead the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents in a sense the showdown promised by mr hammarskjolds sudden and tragic death has been avoided no precedents have been set as yet structurally the un is still fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong to the hills girls no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade these are mentalities which crave action and they are beginning to get it as messrs salsich and engh report on page  even in areas where political connotations are deliberately left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading friends a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley alabama if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast the account reads they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commandotrained telephone employees all girls  heavily armed and mobilized as a fastmoving civil defense outfit  operators and office personnel  stand ready to move into action at a minutes notice according to friends the unit was organized by john snook a former world war ii commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company the girls very fetching in their uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols rifles and other such ladies accessories this may be opera bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means the doctrine has never worked it is not working now the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms it cannot bring them into actual play a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined as the civic temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier but the guns are real soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst all false gods resemble moloch at least in the early phases of their careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idolworship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice but there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish cult of the motorcar is exceeding all bounds in its demands the annual butchery of  american men women and children to satiate its bloodlust is excessive a quota of  a year would be more than sufficient no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace if the railroads for example regularly slaughtered  passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical here then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning from next new years day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all media of communication to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meatwagon has picked up the twentyfive thousandth corpse but let the twentyfive thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the  state highway commissioners then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july   the scene of course should be nine miles northwest of centralia illinois the geographical center of population according to the census a special grandstand protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois should be erected for occupancy by honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized the band should play the rogues march as a processional switching to hail columbia happy land as the trap is sprung independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it the highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds up  americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for the better moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put true the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor even a miniscule sect and their credo homekeeping hearts are happiest is as disreputable as socinianism nonetheless although few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia robert ruarks grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this gallivantin in any event the yearly sacrifice of  victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason since appeals to morality to humanity and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond  per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson to hang  governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways so all things considered the highway commissioners would seem to be elected as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race but the guilt is shared by the united states britain and france the other members of the atomic club until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september  the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down as it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years and on to succeeding generations so while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat shock dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions a holierthanthou sermon was not on october  after the soviets had detonated at least  nuclear devices ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country in self protection might have to resume aboveground tests more recently the chairman of the atomic energy commission dr glenn t seaborg admitted to a news conference in las vegas nevada that the us might fall behind russia he apparently meant in weapons development if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain the trial balloons are afloat all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood but for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of sciences worstmarked channels full of tricky currents and unknown depths the scientists in and out of government do not agree on some of the most vital points at least publicly on the one hand the public health service declared as recently as october  that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the us but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states then it added it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be nor how many people will be affected having hedged its bets in this way phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all at present radiation levels and even at somewhat higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected then to conclude on an indeterminate note nevertheless if fallout increased substantially or remained high for a long time it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world dr linus pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with him or not after declaring in an article last month in frontier magazine that the russian testing carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled  megatons the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations  children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects longlived carbon from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next  generations and between  and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiationproduced diseases such as leukemia most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout is concentrating paulings estimate of  megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high but a total of  megatons is a distinct possibility the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from which agreedon generalizations could be drawn but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing an illustration of this attitude is found in john a mccones letter to dr thomas lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout a recent study on radiation exposure by the aecs division of biology and medicine stated the question of the biological effect  of radiation doses is not considered herein of course the aec is in a bind now if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests so the commissions announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually left vague now of course that the russians are the nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mids when the us was testing in the atmosphere the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good for you might not be much worse than a bad cold after a nuclear blast one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof things arent that simple anymore yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count how much fallout will we get as of october  the aec had reported  shots in the new soviet series  of them in a megaton range including a super bomb with a yield of  to  megatons the equivalent of  million to  million tons of tnt and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at  megatons a conservative computation is that the  announced tests produced a total yield of at least  megatons some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to  megatons and that the full megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a fission yield of  to  megatons thus far to this must be added the  to  megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in  and the informal threepower test moratorium that began in november  resuming atmospheric tests one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that is has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself that dilemma is as much with us as ever the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests when this second dilemma first became obvious during the mid to late s the united states appeared to have three choices it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination or it could have chosen to find by negotiation some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security this third choice was in fact made with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks however the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken once again the united states must choose and once again the choices are much the same only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder the first choice abandoning tests entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely be exploited by the russians the second choice full testing has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere the third choice negotiation presupposes as russian behavior demonstrates a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable we take the position however that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice one which should it fail will not have contaminated the conscience that is the contamination we most fear  leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing in particular governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests speaking recently in miami governor rockefeller said that to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the united states is to do confidently and firmly not what is popular but what is right what was missing in the governors argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right the possibility as he asserted that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise unless of course we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governors case one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the contrary assured us that our lead is very great unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us the facts do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric testing it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary and even justifiable but a resumption does not seem justifiable now what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests has radically increased our own moral obligations we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start ecumenical hopes when his holiness pope john xxiii first called for an ecumenical council and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church as it has turned out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy first of all it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light equally significant pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church the establishment by the holy father of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in  was the most dramatic mark of this concern the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as official observers reverses the churchs earlier stand the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state cardinal cicognani for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act nor can one forget pope johns unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury augustin cardinal bea the director of the secretariate for christian unity has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the churchs stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone for discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god the irresistible efficacy of prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit can any christian fail to respond to these words the budget deficit the administrations official budget review which estimates a  billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isnt making anyone happy certainly it isnt making the president happy and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year we sympathize with mr kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesnt please us either although for very different reasons furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring in the first place a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhowers estimate of a  billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing presidents farewell gift of a political boobytrap to his successor the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received the rest of the deficit is also easily understood four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated by the pennywise policies of the eisenhhower administration quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower the farm program will cost an additional  billion because of unusual weather factors the food for peace program and other new measures antirecession programs aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed areas account for only  million of the  billion dollar deficit our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arms buildup and in aid and welfare measures and yet mr kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and economizing we wish the president would remember that fiscal responsibility was the battlecry of the party that lost the election the party that won used to say something about a new frontier ethics and peace introduction of the dialogue principle proved strikingly effective at the thirtyfourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants and when the speaker was a catholic one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion several effects were immediately evident sessions devoted to ethics and foreign policy trends moral principle and political judgment christian ethics in the cold war and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves usually questions from the floor were directed to the noncatholic speaker or discussion leader in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law which dr william v obrien of georgetown university advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy that aristoteleanthomistic principle experienced a thorough goingover from a number of the participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself speakers declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps by some other name a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the divine law while a caip member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new un nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent the impression was unmistakable that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each others positions and better comprehension of ones own but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues one effect of the spirited giveandtake of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use to defend berlin for example the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question i was searching for an accent of selfdelusion or even of hypocrisy i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted they were almost all members of the official family who presumably harbor official thoughts but i questioned also professional soldiers who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarians dreamy irredentism their answer was it can be done and we will do it and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kaishek in america i said practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to reenter the mainland what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that and that it can be done he smiled he always smiles at least at visitors i gather he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine questions i recalled sympathetically the dukes complaint in brownings my last duchess  he smiled and said a word or two to the interpreter who turned to me the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei that i smarted is a royal rebuff if ever there was one i answered the routine question about my itinerary rather coolly chiang spoke again this time at greater length the president says the translator came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia and that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return is feasible he would merely sound redundant so you yourself must seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal fair enough what are the relevant data for every person on taiwan there are sixty in mainland china if the raw population figures are crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia relative military manpower less than  but at least  the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army say four million the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about  though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated skill training morale it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained the morale is very high even so it adds up to impossible odds except that the question arises on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight the miserable people of china the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves resist overtly they think perforce of physical survival everything else is secondary but the army which mao continues to feed well where are its sympathies the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in china over thousands of years it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives who are close to starvation the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews their privations are almost beyond endurance in behalf of what leninismmarxism as understood by exegete mao to whom will the generals stay loyal there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out on the farm it is another question whether they or a single general off in a corner of china secure for a few galvanizing days at least from instant retaliation will defy the party but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there  but there must be a catalytic pressure the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal the first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural poverty for years the family is largely broken up and where it is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is enormous for it is the family that in china has always provided social security for the indigent the sick the downandout members of the clan now the government must do that but the government is left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security the second mistake is tibet tibet has historically served china as a buffer state a friendly state sometimes only semiindependent but never hostile china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the peoples religion and institutions red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france these continuing pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension the imposition of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap  the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control first and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime on these they feel they can rely secondly they depend on americas moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest we will receive the opportunity gladly i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day he affected most properly not to understand my point but he and all of china wear the scars of american indecisiveness and he knows what an uncertain ally we are we have been grand to formosa itself lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support for the offshore islands but our outlook has been and continues to be defensive a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr kennedys views on the world struggle the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation the moment of truth is the moment of crisis during the slow buildup the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details fine words strutting gestures the crisis burns these suddenly away there the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look the moment passes new selfdeceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the toonaked bones a truthrevealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies before memory too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of public men at many levels one knows better now who has bone and who has jelly in his spine but i am here concerned more with policy than with men public men come and go but great issues of policy remain now everyone knows or knew in the week of december  that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most prowestern and anticommunist within any of the new nations the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was in reality the principal the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies to the entire western community by our policy the west was is split but the key revelation is not new the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungarysuez crisis of november  it reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in cuba last spring with which the dominican events of last month should be paired at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles in relation to laos algeria south africa right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally linked complex of tshombegizengagoaghana what the moments reveal this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy the u s can take the initiative against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form of regime what particular issue the u s cannot take the initiative against the left there is even some question whether the u s can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left we can attack tshombe but not gigenza no matter that gizenga is moscows man in the congo no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa even granted that the congo should be unified you dont protect western security by first removing the prowestern weight from the power equilibrium we can force britain and france out of the suez but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest we can mass our fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall much less give the simple order to push the wall down we officially receive the antifrench moscowallied algerian fln but we denounce the proeurope anticommunist oas as criminal in the very week of our war against katanga we make a  million grant to kwame nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship as our planes land the war materiel that kills prowestern katangans we stand supinely bleating while nehrus troops smash into a fivehundredyearold district of our nato ally portugal what explains this unidirectional paralysis it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international and in some degree our domestic policy the suezhungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and more active key to the puzzles most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa katanga and ghana as to the suezhungary crisis before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the uncommitted neutralist contested nations especially on those whose leaders make the most noise nehru tito nkrumah sukarno betancourt etc our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes if we grasp this orientation as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left broadway the unoriginals to write a play the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the craft to develop

technique the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense producers cannot afford to take chances but that explanation is only partly true offbroadway where production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly more original laudably enough it is offering classics and offbeat imports but last week only one us original was on the boards robert d hocks stunning civil war work borak the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of us playwrights nightclubs the cooch terpers he come with me to the casbah she by subway or cab that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan as more and more new yorkers were discovering th street and eighth avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing several more will open soon their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the nd street burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis the belly boites with their papiermache palm trees or handpainted ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families customers often bring their children between performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor the people watch in calm absorption small shirtsleeved orchestras

the harem continuum of mankind if a dancer is good she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny the continuum of mankind but a great many of what variety calls the cooch terpers are considerably less cosmic than that each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room this is done at varying speeds ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli a musical term meaning double strings to the fastest ecstatic karshilama meaning greetings or welcome the new york dancers are highly eclectic varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends or floor crawls but they do not strip the striptease is crass the belly dance leaves more to the imagination when a dancer does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers costumes with tips the girls average between  and  a week depending on basic salary although they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in midshimmy the melting pot all over the country belly clubs have never been bigger

several agents notably voluble blackbearded murat somay a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen he can offer nine turkish girls plans to import at least  more but a great many of the dancers are more or less native sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted by lebanese and syrians in the us where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly some manhattan examples  jemela surname gerby  seems hong kong

turtleneck sweater for a buttondown collar a short tormented span of the handful of painters that austria has produced in the th century only one oskar kokoschka is widely known in the us this state of unawareness may not last much longer for ten years a small group of european and us critics has been calling attention to the halfforgotten austrian expressionist egon schiele who died  years ago at the age of  the critics campaign finally inspired the first major us exhibit of schieles works the show has been to boston and manhattan will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis last week it opened at the j b speed museum in louisville at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau gallery in los angeles schieles paintings are anything but pleasant his people see color are angular and knobbyknuckled sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened his colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination the devil himself the son of a railway stationmaster schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln  miles northwest of vienna he was an emotional lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork when he was  his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna even there he did not last for long cried one professor after a few months of student schieles tantrums and rebellion the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom for a while his work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists and by the patterned mosaiclike paintings of gustav klimt then the dean of austrian art gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter his pictures were roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen in vienna he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for  days the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle for years he wore handmedown suits and homemade paper collars was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in viennas gutters drafted into the austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a vienna billet went on painting it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show melancholy obsession the unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbidminded vienna he was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust the children he painted were almost always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness and his nudes including several selfportraits were stringy contorted and strangely pathetic the subject he liked most was the female body which he painted in every state naked halfdressed muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace the most surprising thing about the twentysecond congress of the soviet communist party is that it was surprising perhaps quite as much in its own way as the twentieth congress of  which ended with that famous secret report on stalin the publication last july of the partys draft program that blueprint for the transition to communism had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twentysecond congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in fact been current over the last three or four years ie since the defeat of the antiparty group in all theoretical party journals these never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of marx and lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment of a communist society had now under khrushchev become an immediate and tangible reality it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a worldshaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program a large part of his twelvehour speech at the recent congress was in fact very largely a rehash of that interminable document he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an all peoples state and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of the whole hierarchy of soviets starting with the supreme soviet itself their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in running the country also elections would be more democratic there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from no doubt there was still a lot in the draft program and in khrushchevs speech which left many points obscure was it the partys intention for example to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wageearning sovkhozes ie state farms which were moreover to be progressively urbanized as we know the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot and it is still very far from certain how valid the partys claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm if one follows the reports of the congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter the draft program was interesting in other respects too it contained for example a number of curious admissions about the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no oldage pensions no paid holidays they still benefit far less than the other  per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being  over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in  the ordinary people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry this was something on which k himself seemed to have some doubts for he kept on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible for agricultural production and as we know the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchevs agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the antiparty group molotov malenkov kaganovich and others including the eightyyearold marshal voroshilov molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds of sins especially with wanting to cut down free public services to increase rents and fares in fact with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev welfare state the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what in the secret councils of the kremlin molotov had really proposed we just dont know and he has had no chance to reply  but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this nonstop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated antiparty group would be totally unnecessary if there were not inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress mikoyan declared molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war his views in fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed peace one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the antiparty group are not being used as chinas whippingboys by khrushchev and his faithful followers for something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in sovietchinese relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated the effect of chou enlais clash with khrushchev together with the everlasting attacks on molotov  co has shifted the whole attention of the world including that of the soviet people from the epochmaking twentyyear program to the present sovietchinese conflict not only as we know did chou enlai publicly treat khrushchevs attack on albania as something that we cannot consider as a serious marxistleninist approach to the problem ie as something thoroughly dictatorial and undemocratic but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on it is extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends the big question is whether in the name of a restored chinesesoviet solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev or get rid of enver hoxa these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy incident can now be closed but albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia there are other symptoms khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like above all the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russoamerican honeymoon of  but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere in the first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby which i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago exists on the quiet inside the party to these people solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russias future policy and the chinese as the albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the west the fact that china which is obsessed by formosa to khrushchev a very small matter should be supported by north korea and north vietnam is highly indicative and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west wasnt trying to keep the chinese quiet and this brings us inevitably to the  or megaton bomb was not this dropped primarily in order to appease the chinese especially after khrushchevs humiliating surrender to the west in canceling the german peacetreaty deadline of december  what does it all add up to indications are that khrushchev and with him the bulk of the soviet people favor peaceful coexistence and with the exception of berlin the maintenance of the status quo in the world the chinese north vietnamese and north koreans on the other hand feel that militarily russia is strong enough to support them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark on before long with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since  when the antiparty group nearly liquidated him he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition but if he is up against chinas crusading spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life he may support china but he wont he may break with china which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions in persuading china to be patient the next days may show where things stand on a misty sunday morning last month a small band of militant anticommunists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here eleven men a woman and a teenage boy tramped over cold damp fogenshrouded ground during a twohour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare to the average american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie but to the minutemen this is a serious business they feel that the united states is engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy they feel that world war iii has already begun and they are setting themselves up as a last line of defense against the communist advance their national leader robert bolivar depugh of norborne mo says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red onslaught in their maneuvers last month they wore world war ii camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded m rifles the maneuvers were held in secret after a regional seminar for the minutemen held in nearby shiloh ill had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville ill and seized four operative weapons including a browning machine gun two browning automatic rifles and an m rifle undismayed by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchlis home at  am the next day put on their uniforms and headed for a farm several miles away a  mm mortar and a  mm recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war ii army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long low ridge and a creekfilled gully here the two leaders depugh and lauchli hastened to put the group through its paces the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment eleven dummy rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapidfire mortar shooting mrs depugh the mother of five children and an active member of her husbands organization participated in all the exercises there were no casualties but the guerrillas admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called a halt at  am to enable outoftown members to catch a plane tenure as criterion i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell kirk dec  it has to do with teachers salaries and tenure next september after receiving a degree from yales master of arts in teaching program i will be teaching somewhere that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers i will also be underpaid the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers teaching is at present a sellers market as a result buyers the public must be satisfied with secondrate teachers but this is not the real problem the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality hence all teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly overpaid it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure here as in all sectors of the economy quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses  loss of initiative on the eve of the great debate on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make acrosstheboard tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community we should face the alternatives on this proposition what we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs  a brief for the negative i disagree with mr burnhams position on the common market nov  as a desirable organization for us to join for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal as well as economic selfrule in entering this union we will be surrendering most if not all of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute recently set up or the oecd imf and others to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market i refer you to an article in the new york times magazine section nov   by mr eric johnston entitled we must join the common market he says it has swept aside petty nationalisms ageold rivalries and wornout customs referring to britain he says we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy placing this authority in continental hands  since the goal of our international planners is a world government this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for once american economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question of time frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense they have us over a barrel listen to what mr johnston has to say consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict  we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need we would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline widespread unemployment but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or economic empire but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry create a free market here give us a sound debtfree money system and well compete with anyone europe and asia combined in short get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we wont have to worry about european competition or communism either if we want to preserve our sovereignty this is the way to do it not acquiesce to an international planning board if we go into this common market we might just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees connally amendments or for that matter conservatism in general  we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a manysided discussion of the atlantic common market which nr will be continuing in our pages ed mental telepathy the peiping chinese

than five years later i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier but in spite of this i at present a man  years of age and a college professor have been recalled by direction of the president to report on november th to fort devens massachusetts for another twelve months of active duty as an sp  the equivalent of a pfc today seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st michaels college for after leaving the army in  i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto this time added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my induction in  makes a total of twentytwo  years of education the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys with this no loyal citizen can quarrel however it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes in my own case i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking taken back into the army now as an sp  i am leaving  college students whose teacher i am a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes at this late date it is impossible for st michaels college to find a suitable replacement for me even apart from the fact that now at the age of  my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and

me no end if the hessian troops sent here willynilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the s were mercenaries what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo willynilly by their governments to fight for the united nations if the un troops are not mercenaries then the hessians were not mercenaries either and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then

for the indonesian anticommunist insurgents us pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of indonesia facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty he said i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu and i have helped in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free world i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination at least in indonesia khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism since then nothing has happened to save the life of pope i found recently a very small article in the new york times us flier loses plea indonesia court upholds popes death sentence indonesia military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence pope an american pilot pope was convicted last year of having aided north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions he has been in prison since may  when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency as we see pope may appeal to president sukarno khrushchevs friend for clemency this possibility is anything but reassuring the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan pope are tractors available for him does anybody think of saving the life of an anticommunist american pilot  an analogy a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote louis capet the week june  another analogy had occurred to me consider this table  louis xiv fdr  with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government  regency truman a dustsettling period of decadence and decline  louis xv eisenhower  he opened his mouth said little and thought not at all  louis xvi kennedy  not completely virtuous but completely incompetent and marie antoinette jacqueline bouvier  the beautiful and lighthearted  french revolution conservative revolution truly that liberals should choose louis xiv as a bogeysymbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic considering the louis xiv character of their grand monarque fdr not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification le roi gouverne par lui meme but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies in defeating louis capet john towers victory in texas signals once again the end of the divine right of liberalism confrontation it seems to me that nc in his editorial confrontation sr mar  has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer this affects us all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress i know of no other solution than the one nc proposes to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically  thank you for the illustrated editorial confrontation it is both great writing and profound religion  nc has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece  i feel that nc hit the very core of our existence in the editorial confrontation personally it meant a great deal my only hope is that it will be shared by many many others  confrontation should fortify us all whether in southeast asia or the us  congratulations to nc for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps i concur that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands it would be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into  the editorial confrontation was certainly direct in its appear to those of us living here in america i personally gained strength from it thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world  ncs editorial confrontation is a stunning piece of writing i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it the important people to humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros  but the schweitzers and the dooleys and the others like them whose names we will never know  editors note reprints of confrontation will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps a peace corps official described the editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers improper bostonian f l lucass article in srs april  issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers rather than the comment by cleveland amory in his first of the month column it is blind fundamentalist dogmatism to say messing around with the king james version  seems to us a perilous sport at best  facts in focus lester markel is on the right track in his article interpretation of interpretation sr mar  the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago we dont need this type of protection any more the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media besides there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities first it does not communicate a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns despite several years of frontpage stories the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors  southern california blackout i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president kennedys activities so far as southern california is concerned you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions to begin with the allpowerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president next because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day up until now the networks have grudgingly run halfhour tapes at  pm or sometimes  or  pm even then a few of the less interesting questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator however last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs this is no criticism of them as they obviously cannot get a halfhour program into a fifteenminute news summary the radio stations did run transcripts i thought during the evening hours however by comparing the tv snatches two different radio station reruns and the censored los angeles times version i found that the radio stations had edited out questions abc removed the one regarding laos or even a paragraph out of the middle of the presidents answer i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the abuse he is being subjected to we out here dont see enough of the conference to know he is being abused i dont know if this is the situation in other parts of the country apparently it is not it also happened with the inauguration which was not rerun at all during the evening hours and i wrote to the tv editor of the times he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations not doing this but nothing happened can you bring the networks attention to this  for a college of propaganda i was interested in james webb youngs madison avenue column in which he raised the question do we need a college of propaganda sr feb  in my estimation we definitely do and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die during the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the various shades of grey in between we had a couple of schools in this country the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyds neck there were also a couple in canada and several in england the english schools preceded ours and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching four of us here in the united states attended first as students then as instructors almost every one of these schools in england canada and the united states we set up the lloyds neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it when the end did come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so alas no such thing happened there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way  congratulations on the article do we need a college of propaganda this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years and i certainly hope it sparks some action  let the media clean house too many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l tobin chose to devote his editorial in the march  communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association snow storm i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march  a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published whether in his forthcoming book c p snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important one should be able to get hold of the book at once but the attack was made from an advance copy if this practice should take root and spread the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of postmortem formality  editors note sir robert watsonwatt wrote on page  of sr research for  march  i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled science and government until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail but i have compared its text with already published commentaries on the  series of godkin lectures at harvard from which the book was derived and i can with confidence challenge the gist of c p snows incautious tale watsonwatts remarks in sr did not then constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures representatives of harvard university press which is publishing the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the books publication date the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt  sir robert watsonwatts rebuttal of sir charles snows godkin lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods in an unclear incoherent argument the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning it calls the conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike a perverted conclusion  nonsense it submits an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles account we are left to choose between the two lindemanns the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee and dissembling discounted it inside if so i would lean to sir charles conception of the man i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it  it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals and where thursday night he celebrated his th season with the chicago symphony orchestra playing the brahms concerto with his own slashing demonridden cadenza melting into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music or forever finds it closed there was about that song something incandescent for this brahms was milstein at white heat not the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent those would be reserved for the orchestras great nights when the soloist can surpass himself this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point that is when mr milstein thrust straight to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing glittering and sometimes spitting mr hendl could go along but mr hendl does not go straight to any point he flounders and lets music sprawl there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein but not great brahms the concert opened with another big romantic score schumanns overture to manfred which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic point to keep it afloat hindemiths joust with weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit it got the kind of scrambled coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style bayreuth next summer the bayreuth festival opens july  with a new production of tannhaeuser staged by wieland wagner who is doing all the operas this time and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch sawalisch also conducts the flying dutch opening july  parsifal follows july  with hans knappertsbusch conducting and he also conducts die meistersinger to be presented aug  and  the ring cycles are july    and  and aug    and  rudolf kempe conducts no casts are listed but lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano grace bumbry will sing venus in tannhaeuser remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago missed seeing the bolshoi ballet remember how by lack of two big theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet well now we have two big theaters but barring a miracle and dont hold your breath for it chicago will not see the leningradkirov ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times indeed we did the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in mccormick place which sol hurok ballet booker extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country and of course he doesnt weep at the capacity either  it was all set allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec  thru  later the hurok office made it dec  thru  a nice long booking for the full repertory but if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict allied arts had booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec  and  something had to give not la dietrich allied arts then notified us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking fly here to open nov  and close dec  shorter booking but still a booking we printed it a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake so i started making some calls of my own these are the results  the kirov ballet is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium los angeles nov  thru dec  not a chance of opening here nov  barring that miracle then why not the juicy booking hurok had held for us well dietrich wont budge from mccormick place then how about the civic opera house well allied arts has booked lena horne there for a week starting dec  queried about the impasse allied arts said better cancel the kirov for the time being its all up in the air again so the kirov will fly back to russia minus a chicago engagement a serious loss for dance fans and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country will somebody please reopen the auditorium paintings and drawings by marie moore of st thomas virgin islands are shown thru nov  at the meadows gallery  ellis av week days  p m to  p m sundays  p m to  p m closed mondays   an exhibition of evelyn cibulas paintings will open with a reception nov  at the evanston community center  davis st it will continue all month  abstractions and semiabstractions by everett mcnear are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame until nov  in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget the dallas civic opera will use san franciscos new leni bauerecsy production of lucia di lammermoor this season returning the favor next season when san francisco uses the dallas don giovanni designed by franco zeffirelli h e bates has scribbled a farce called hark hark the lark it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans it is hard to find perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics anyway a number of them meet here in devastating collisions one is an imperial london stockbroker called jerebohm another is a wily countryman called larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled i believe in earlier volumes of mr bates comedie humaine whats up now well jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities they want to own a juniorgrade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers they are willing to settle however in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at and of course larkin has just the thing they want splendor by sorcery its a horror the name of it is gore court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t s eliot thats not precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it though he conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor the stainedglass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform the vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch larkin has an answer to all that the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids also perhaps tabletennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented its a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse he doesnt really need the immense sum of money probably converted from american gold on the london exchange he makes them pay for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot he has a glorious wife and many children when he needs money to buy something like say the rollsroyce he keeps near his vegetable patch he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies one of those capitalgains ventures in fact has saddled him with gore court he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a foxs life on earth first one then the other if in larkins eyes they are nothing but piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living mr bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war first the larkins are ahead then the jerebohms after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers one of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from kiplings tales of india does not approve of the way larkin gets his birds he doesnt think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from miguel de cervantes don quixote is the brilliant russian spectacle done in wide screen and color which opened yesterday at the fiftyfifth street and sixtyeighth street playhouses more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragicomic knighterrant and his squire sancho panza in seventeenthcentury spain this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character  nikolai cherkasov the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible performs the lanky don quixote and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man his addlebrained knighterrant selfappointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knighterrantry had become a joke is as cervantes no doubt intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues cherkasov does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do he treats this deepeyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue the voices of all the characters including that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personalities and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed since russian was being spoken instead of spanish there is no violation of artistry or logic here splendid too is the performance of yuri tolubeyev one of russias leading comedians as sancho panza the fat grotesque squire though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don he gives it a firmness and toughness a sort of peasant dignity too it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is one of the best in the film  true the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half before don quixote goes to the dukes court but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange also on the bill at the fiftyfifth street is a nice tenminute color film called sunday in greenwich village a tour of the haunts and joints television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicagostyle jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for chicago and all that jazz presented on nbctv nov  the program came out of the nbc special projects department and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents as a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with pleasing results a few years ago a timex allstar show offered a broad range of styles ranging from lionel hamptons big band to the freewheeling dukes of dixieland an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance about that same time john crosbys tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music cameras stared at soloists faces in extreme closeups then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work chicago and all that jazz could not be faulted on the choice of artists some of the inperson performers were jack teagarden gene krupa bud freeman pee wee russell johnny st cyr joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley the jazz buff could hardly ask for more furthermore garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies he played host at the timex show already mentioned one of the scripts big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share for example there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold samples soomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and s however well chosen and cleverly arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evenings main business which considering the talent at hand should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse similarly in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close perusal chicago and all that jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for todays artists the program turned out to be a notquiteperfect example of either still the networks willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily anticipated even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as lucia in donizettis lucia di lammermoor sunday night the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic mad scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers her entrance in scene  act  brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note thereafter the audience waxed applausehappy but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization as she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of lucia she topped the sextet brilliantly each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the mad scene but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her role what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today this big flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly in the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently technically it was fascinating aurally spellbinding and dramatically quite realistic many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor silvio varviso he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them in a singers opera may be quite difficult richard tucker sang edgardo in glorious voice his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable miss sutherland first sang lucia at covent garden in  the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec  will introduce her as lucia she has since turned to bellini whose opera beatrice di tenda in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season she will sing la sonambula with it here next week anyone for musical pingpong its really quite fun as long as you like games you will need a stereo music system with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and one or more of the new london phase  records there are  of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the star release pass in review sp this features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand complete with crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of realism this disc displays londons new technique to the best effect all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound london explains that the very distinct directional effect in the phase  series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active cooperation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects some clue to the character of londons approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the  titles include the word percussion or percussive drums xylophones castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right they are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley the percussive twenties sp stirs pleasant memories with wellknown songs of that day and johnny keatings kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive moods sp big band percussion sp seemed one of the least attractive discs the arrangements just didnt have so much character as the others there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies the penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant but brassy piano sounds in melody and percussion for two pianos sp all of the releases however are recorded at a gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic strange but true authenticity and realism often arent related at all almost every film bearing the imprimatur of hollywood is physically authentic in fact impeccably so in any given period piece the costumes bricabrac vehicles and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter during the making recently of an important biblical film some  volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and complied with but alas the authenticity seems to stop at the sets edge the drama itself and this seems to be lavishly true of biblical drama often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all the storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic thus in the story of ruth we have ruth naomi and boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline ie that ruth remained with naomi and finally wound up with boaz the film version has little to do with the bible and in the new king of kings the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the gospels earlier this month edward r murrow director of the united states information agency came to hollywood and had dinner with more than  leaders of the motion picture industry he talked about unauthentic storylines too he intimated that they werent doing the country much good in the cold war and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism in many corners of the globe he said the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet would we want a futureday gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge yet for much of the globe hollywood is just that prime if not sole source of knowledge if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone what conclusions do you think he might come to francois dalbert hungarianborn violinist who made his new york debut three years ago played a return engagement last night in judson hall he is now president of the chicago conservatory college his pianist was donald jenni a faculty member at depaul university the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists so that for the first half of the program when the piano was partially open mr jennis playing was too loud in vying with him mr dalbert also seemed to be overdriving his tone this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances however except in the case of the opening work mozarts sonata in a k  which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion brahms sonata in a although also vigorous stood up well under the two artists strong largescale treatment mr dalbert has a firm attractive tone which eschews an overly sweet vibrato he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance a sonata for violin and piano called bella bella by robert fleming was given its first united states performance the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board of canada the works two movements one melodically sentimental the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a ravellike style but they rehash a wornout idiom they might well indicate conjugal felicity but in musical terms that smack of hollywood works by dohnanyi hubay mr dalbert himself and paganini indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase standard items by sarasate and saintsaens completed the program  in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium but her program last night at town hall was the greekborn pianists first new york recital since  miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century it was in them that miss xydis was at her best the rachmaninoff prelude no  op  for instance gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities the ability to produce fine deepsounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured rich in color and songful and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs miss xydis earlier selections were mendelssohns variations serieuses in which each variation was nicely set off from the others haydns sonata in e minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and chopins sonata in b flat minor a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianists performance so what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing all the generals who held important commands in world war ii did not write books it only seems as if they did and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written one of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in england it is defeat into victory by field marshal viscount slim a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally field marshal slim has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and countermoves are more interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the field marshal himself william joseph slim first viscount slim former governor general of australia was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of  when the illprepared illequipped british forces were outmaneuvered outfought and outgeneraled he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas indians africans chinese and british and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war the forgotten war his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines parts of defeat into victory are a tangle of burmese place names and military units but a little application makes everything clear enough on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally wellwritten book field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error he praises many individuals generously he himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent more intellectual and selfcritical than most soldiers remaking an army to win defeat into victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action before he could return to burma field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits his remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are enlightening he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass british american and chinese health hygiene medical aid and preventive medicine hospitals inadequate and nurses scanty food and military supplies logistics and transport airdrops and airstrips roads and river barges to be built expected of a commander commenting on these and other matters field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks when in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the bolder the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory for that is his duty it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them it depresses them so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders of the japanese private he says he fought and marched till he died if  japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to kill  before it was ours and then the last five killed themselves brooding about future wars the field marshal has this to say the asian fighting man is at least equally brave as the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him he is by background and living standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources a bunch of young buckaroos from out west who go by the name of texas boys choir loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience actually the program they sang was at least twothirds serious and highminded and they sang it beautifully under the capable direction of the choirs founder geroge bragg the twentysix boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets excerpts from pergolesis stabat mater and all of the britten ceremonial of carols their singing was wellbalanced clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional waver and now and then a bleat but mr bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior most surprising of all he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words the latin for example was not only clear it was even beautiful furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music lines came out neatly and in good balance tempos were lively the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly other capable soloists included david clifton joseph schockler and pat thompson the final group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume boys will be boys and texans will be texans the combination proved quite irresistible last night  the polish song and dance company called mazowsze after the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a threeweek engagement at the city center last night a thoroughly ingratiating company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome highspirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification the material is all basically of folk origin gleaned from every section of poland but under the direction of mira ziminskasygietynska who with her late husband founded the organization in  it has all been put into theatrical form treated selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators and performed altogether professionally under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing  since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters the stage is constantly full of them indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers they can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed there is for example a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act the mazurka choreographed by witold zapala to music from moniuszkos opera strasny dwor may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see there is an enchanting polonaise and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the onstage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth the theatrebythesea matunuck presents king of hearts by jean kerr and eleanor brooke directed by michael murray settings by william david roberts the cast  producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his seasons opener at matunuck in jean kerrs king of hearts the dialogue is sharp witty and candid typical dont eat the daisies material which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays and it was obvious that the theatrebythesea audience liked it the story is of a famous strip cartoonist an arty individual whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts a yearold to provide him with fresh idea material this is when his troubles begin not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect to the heros sweetheartsecretary john heffernan playing larry larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion his portrayal of an edgy headintheclouds artist is virtually flawless this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of david hedison providences contribution to hollywood who is appearing by special arrangement with th centuryfox not that mr hedison does not make the most of his role he does and more but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it has to be that way a word should be said for gary morgan a broadway youngsters who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular and for his playmate francis coletta of west warwick who has a bit part billy on the whole audiences will like this performance it is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the matunuck cast does well by it the newport playhouse presents epitaph for george dillon by john osborne and anthony creighton directed by wallace gray the cast  the angriest young man in newport last night was at the playhouse where epitaph for george dillon opened as the jazz festival closed for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session hes mad at a world he did not make furthermore hes something of a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all fingertips this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well it is into this household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play an unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists by the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other shells not altogether a successful play epitaph for george dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling it is awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel groom as dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another this is an exciting young actor to watch just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment also fine are sue lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive harold cherry as her scratchy spouse and hildy weissman as a vegetable in human form wallace gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair the warwick musical theater presents wheres charley with music and lyrics by frank loesser directed by christopher hewett choreography by peter conlow musical direction by samuel matlowsky the cast  everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater and shelley berman was to blame one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented once in love with amy is also of course one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act ii got a rousing opening chorus wheres charley and berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being it is greatly to bermans credit that he made no attempt to outdo ray bolger he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called charleys aunt and let himself go with as an appealing an amy as anybody could ask in brief berman played himself and not bolger the big audience started applauding even before he had finished the whole production this week is fresh and lively the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days the ballet work is on the nose especially in the opening number by the new ashmolean marching society and students conservatory band along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later berman whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist proved himself very much at home in musical comedy sparrowsize virginia gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile made a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon as the real aunt was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner all told wheres charley ought not to be missed it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right mr berman the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c edwin knills and martin tahses production of fiorello at veterans memorial auditorium the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyrics by sheldon harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart musical direction by jack elliott and the production was directed by mr abbott the cast  this is one of the happier events of the season the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the little flower rides to break a lance again i saw fiorello performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good and perhaps better certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley does but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello as the evening progressed until one had to catch ones self up and remember that this wasnt really laguardia come back among us again then rudy bond was simply grand as ben the distraught republican party district chieftain and paul lipson as morris the faithful one who never gets home to his shirleys dinner was fine too as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest little man charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie who became the second mrs laguardia singing and acting with remarkable conviction jen nelson as thea his first wife managed to make that short role impressive and little zeme north a dora with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of on the side of the angels and politics and poker were handled splendidly and i thought rudy bond and his band of tuneful wardheelers made little tin box even better than it was done by the new york cast all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity the party at floyds penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the eras nonsense laguardias multilingual rallies when he is running for congress are well staged and wind up in a wild jewish folkdance that is really great musical theater martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions not a corner has been visibly cut in this one the sets are remarkably elaborate for a roadshow that doesnt pause long in any one place and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes im glad to say theres none of that distraction in this fiorello it has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater loews theater presents where the boys are an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells the cast  since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich brown senior while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists i suppose i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on where the boys are but i shall do nothing of the sort instead and not just to prove my objectivity i hasten to report that its a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group that is to say sex the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual if most of them werent exactly specific well thats the way it is in life i guess but at least its reassuring to see some teenagers who dont profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead where the boys are also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid is performing most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar dolores hart is charming in a leading role and quite believable i was delighted with paula prentiss comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as ones highest hopes might ask a couple of the males made good comedy too jim hutton and frank gorshin the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases i suppose this was the attitude the part called for i must say however that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining the second feature the price of silence is a british detective story that will talk your head off the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same openminded relish for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment for this latest addition to the great letters series under the general editorship of louis kronenberger miss hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of jamess genius not to mention the felicities of his style and how he could write his famous criticism of brother henrys third style is surely as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latters intricate air castles as henry himself could ever have produced his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grownup penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor  most of all his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain whiteheads reference to james as that adorable genius miss hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication or even desire for communication between differing schools of thought it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of opprobrium to millions of wellmeaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues to his harvard colleague josiah royce whose philosophic position differed radically from his own james could write different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other social influence ever has and in converse with you i have always felt that my life was being lived importantly of another colleague george santayana he could write the great event in my life recently has been the reading of santayanas book although i absolutely reject the platonism of it i have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page  writing to his colleague george herbert palmer glorious old palmer as he addresses him james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce santayana palmer and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life and worth fighting for then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems  the world might ring with the struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other the belaboring is of course jocular yet james was not lacking in fundamental seriousness unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of god to james this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent you ask what i am going to reply to bradley but why need one reply to everything and everybody  i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible impersonally  as far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other here again god will know his own the collected works of james thurber now numbering  volumes including the present exhibit represent a high standard of literary excellence as every schoolboy knows the primitiveeclogue quality of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall is equally well known about all that remains to be said is that the present selection most of which appeared first in the new yorker comprises as usual a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book the one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial article entitled how to get through the day it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate wordgames for insomniacs the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources including in the ps alone palindromes paraphrases and parodies the tyranny of trivia suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled friends romans countrymen lend me your earmuffs such a phrase as drifts through dream and the new vocabularianism some of thurbers curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases  a burlesque paean entitled hark the herald tribune times and all the other angels sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motionpicture ballyhooey how the kooks crumble features an amusingly accurate takeoff on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radiotv commercials and the watchers of the night is a veritable waking nightmare a semiserious literary document entitled the wings of henry james is noteworthy if only for a keenly trenchant though littleknown comment on the masters difficult later period by modest owen wister author of the virginian james he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible  namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings and complexities equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation so much has already been written about everything that you cant find out anything about it or the mildly epigrammatic utterance also a quotation womans place is in the wrong who but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences a tribute to midsummer bangsashes seems terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed its just a bat said my wife reassuringly and i sighed with relief thank god for that i said i thought it was a human being  in a sense perhaps thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter was it salvador dali who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen that is it is literally a picture window you dont see into the viscera you see a picture trees or flowers this is something like what thurbers best effects are like if i am not mistaken though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic penandink sketches several old favorites are scattered through the present volume thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness in his concluding paragraph he writes the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight the latest low is a puzzler the masters hand has lost none of its craft he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and selfdeceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning  anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference it might be argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion the communists wield a power unknown to hitler and the leading issue that of piecemeal aggression remains the same this is drama enough do we ourselves offer mr low less of a crusade in the thirties we would not face our enemy that was a nightmarish situation and low was in his element now we have stood up to the communists we are stronger and more selfconfident and low cannot so easily put us to rights or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now he writes confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views only up to lunchtime whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic dulles he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man mccarthy the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath suez low seems to have supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently so there is no fire in his eye  stalins death churchills farewell to public life hillary and tensing on everest quemoy and matsu all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles their eisenhower is insubstantial did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections he often drew the bomb he showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all but but and but look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale read the moderately brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas a gray fox with a patch on one eye confidence man city slicker lebensraum specialist tries to take over catfish bend in this third relaxed allegory from mr burmans refreshing louisiana animal community the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from new orleans accompanied by one wharf rat but like all despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows more threatening toward those who wont follow such solid citizens as doc raccoon judge black the vegetarian black snake and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington posing for fiftycent pieces as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others they train the mink and other animals to fight and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he wont have anyone around thats against him and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds robert hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes but its hard to imagine mr burman as a nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris uncle remus and the polished witty fables of james thurber george kennans account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war ii is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work scrupulous scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the eras great historical issues in short the book based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university is both reliable and readable the author possesses an uncommonly fine english style and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time if mr kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic well the record itself is not too encouraging mr kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken but he rejects perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and procommunist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february  after all alger hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents was at yalta and harry dexter white implicated in fbi reports in communist associations was one of the architects of the morgenthau plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have simply handed germany to stalin one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength it is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism mr kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way dashed hope you see first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemys power no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with hitler he points out the shocking failure to give support to the antinazi underground which very nearly eliminated hitler in  a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language history and literature kennan recalls how at the time of hitlers attack on the soviet union in  he penned a private note to a state department official expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries the hope was vain with justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement about the history of its diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states he also speaks of franklin d roosevelts puerile assumption that if only he stalin could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like fdr himself ideological preconceptions would melt and russias cooperation with the west could be easily arranged no wonder khrushchevs first message to president kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of roosevelt this fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of world war i and the two instalments of the russian revolution the first of these involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march  the second the seizure of power by the bolsheviks who later called themselves communists in november of the same year as kennan shows the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession of defeating germany they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue this more than any other factor led to the fiasco of allied intervention as the author very justly says had a world war not been in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have been an allied intervention in north russia the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by communist propaganda here kennan operating with precise facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking plebian dictators of many passages in the book that exemplify the authors vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected on stalin this was a man of incredible criminality of a criminality effectively without limits a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity a man in whose entourage none was ever safe a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime  and here is kennans image of hitler stalins temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples and his later enemy behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed like stalin with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift stalin did not possess the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges there is no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan and in a concluding chapter about americas stance in the contemporary world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war but one should not ask for everything mr kennan who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future the story of a quarter of a century of sovietwestern relations is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a firstrate historical narrator the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm in donnybrook there is quite a different eire a rural land where singing dancing fistfighting and romancing are the thing there is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed by and large robert mcenroes adaptation of maurice walshs film the quiet man provides the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one  this is the tale of one john enright an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man but innesfree where ellen roe danaher and her bullying brother will live is no place for a man who will not use his fists so enrights courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded considerably thereby providing the tale which is told you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means then there is a matchmaker one mikeen flynn a role for which eddie foy was happily selected now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented softshoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play mr foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect his matchmaking is naturally incidental and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony art lund a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates enright although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique thats not what an exprize fighter is supposed to have anyway joan fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not plays ellen and sings the role very well too if the mettle which ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind she fits into the general scheme well enough susan johnson as the widow spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one she has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening then there are a pair of old biddies played by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that theyre quite entertaining and in the role of will danaher philip bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army if he chose donnybrook is no brigadoon but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing the ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally competent it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy sez i does a toast to the bride sung by clarence nordstrom playing a character called old man toomey is quite simple direct and touching the men of innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack coles expert choreographic direction the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating rouben terarutunian in his stage settings often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at donnybrook unless they are permanently in the mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable irish we can all breathe more easily this morning more easily and joyously too because joshua logan has turned the stage show fanny into a delightful and heartwarming film the task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnols original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting them again on the screen after their passage through the broadway musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed more than the fans of pagnols old films and of their heroic star the great raimu were looking askance at the project the fans of the musical were too but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the englishdialogue picture at the music hall yesterday whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show whether partial to music or no you cant help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow a tiny handful never did make the concert but after a fifteenminute delay the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoons proceedings they faced a rather small audience as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon it was an excellent concert paul paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid musician and the philharmonic plays for him their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding it was not a heavy ponderous beethoven the music sang nicely sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced  the franck symphonic poem psyche is a lush sweetsounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor if it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying mr paray resisted the temptation to overemphasize the melodic elements of the score he did not let the strings for instance weep whine or get hysterical his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto with zadel skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner mr skolovskys approach to the concerto was bold sweeping and tonally percussive he swept through the music with ease in a nonsentimental and ultraefficient manner  an impressive technician mr skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot his tone is the weakest part of his equipment it tends to be hard and colorless a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs it is after all a nonromantic work even with the big juicy melody of the second movement and the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist but granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr skolovsky supplied taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra mr skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received a new work on the program was nikolai lopatnikoffs festival overture receiving its first new york hearing this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry it is not program music though it runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical and featureless la gioconda like it or not is a singers opera and so of course it is a fans opera as well snow or no the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work so the plot creaks the sets are decaying the costumes are prehistoric the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing after all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed with no less than six leading parts one of those parts is that of evil evil barnaba the spy his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani who was taking the part for the first time with the company he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after all a very oily character regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season they have both sung these parts here before laura is a good role for miss resnik and she gave it force dramatic color and passion mr siepi was as always a consummate actor with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the vocal chords his singing was strong and musical unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality eileen farrell in the title role mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more  melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagined their vanguard album madrigal masterpieces bg  stereo bgs  is a good sample of the special elegant art of english madrigal singing it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french chansons the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else the original impulses came to england late in the sixteenth century and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian interregnum the practice of singing together choruses catches and glees always flourished the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way say the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal early interest latterday interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead of similar revivals in other countries as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal naturally mr deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd thomas morley and thomas tomkins there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture both techniques give the music purity and clarity claude jannequins vocal description of a battle the french equivalents of tarantara rumtumtum and boomboomboom are very picturesque is lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus only with the more sensual intense and baroque expressions of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently reproduced make it an attractive looksee at the period the works are presented chronologically texts and translations are provided elegance and color the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract in france it remained always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor couperin and rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance both composers turn up on new imports from france bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique they specialize in outoftheway items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ld and ld and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master delicate flexible and gemlike the concerts nos     and  are represented are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense the sonatas la francaise la sultane lastree and limperiale are often more elaborately worked out and in fact show a strong italian influence couperin also turns up along with some lesserknown contemporaries on a disk called musique francaise du xviiie siecle bam ld  jeanmarie leclair still is remembered a bit but bodin de beismortier corrette and mondonville are hardly household words what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo the couperin la steinkerque with its battle music brevity wit and refined simplicity already shakes off corelli and points towards the midcentury elegances that ended the baroque era if couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more all these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic rameaus six concerts en sextuor recorded by lorchestre de chambre pierre menet bam ld  turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious maitres allemands des xviie et xviiie siecles contains music by pachelbel buxtehude rosenmueller and telemann well performed by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket bam ld  rococo music a lot of it was played in carnegie recital hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts works by j c bach anton craft joseph haydn giuseppe sammartini comenico dragonetti and j g janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff flutist josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentiethcentury ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez thus there was really an excess of eighteenthcentury charm as one of these lightweight pieces followed another on saturday night each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite tiresome the performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by soloists proving rather trying  ellie mao soprano and frederick fuller baritone presented a program of folksongs entitled east meets west in carnegie recital hall last night they were accompanied by anna mi lee pianist selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao who is a native of china and those of the british isles were sung by mr fuller who is english by birth this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles on the contrary miss mao and mr fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten thre was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise the performances were assured communicative and pleasingly informal  what was omitted from a neglected education were those essentials known as the facts of life chabriers little oneact operetta presented yesterday afternoon at town hall is a fragile precious little piece very french not without wit and charm the poor uneducated newlywed a certain gontran de boismassif has his problems in getting the necessary information the humor of the situation can be imagined it all takes place in the eighteenth century what a silly artificial way of life chabrier and his librettists chuckle but they wish they could bring it back  chabriers delightful music stands just at the point where the classical rationalist tradition handed down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music becomes virtually neoclassicism the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish the simple clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes arlene saunders was charming as poor gontran yes arlene is her name the work uses the old eighteenthcentury tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music it was paired with a darius milhaud opera the poor sailor set to a libretto by jean cocteau a kind of grand guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and gets done in by his wife with the exception of a few spots milhauds music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon sat there and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right before my eyes and the eyes of some  other people i make this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day judy garland has arrived in london shes not chubby shes not plump shes fat but who cares when the lady sings certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet they applauded every number not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme sometimes at the first chord and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the wayout compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings things like when youre smiling almost like being in love do it again born to wander alone together who cares puttin on the ritz how long has this been going on and her own personal songs like the man that got away and the inevitable over the rainbow miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen at the start of her program there were evidences of pique she had held to the letter of her contract and didnt come onto the stage until well after  pm the appointed hour although the music at newport people had tried to get the program underway at  then there was a bad delay in getting mort lindseys piece orchestra wedged into its chairs along about  just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side judy came on singing in a shortskirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their  mm lenses and shoot at extreme range there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and she made the tart observation that i never saw so much moving about in an audience but it didnt take judy garland showman long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it before her chore was finished she was rescuing windblown sheets of music trundling microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere and time after time she really belted out her songs sometimes they struck me as horribly overarranged which was the way i felt about her come rain or come shine and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her shatteringly beautiful beautiful weather to her partisan audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough they were rewarded with splendid exciting singing her rockabye your baby was as good as it can be done and her really personal songs like the man that got away were deeply moving the audience wouldnt let her leave until it had heard over the rainbow although the fellow that kept crying for get happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers all went home happy except the newport police who feared that the throng departing at  might meet headon the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening flashes in the distance but no storm several times it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligans big band which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap mulligans band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligans baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyers arrangement of djangos castle for subtle swinging rhythms i could admire intensely mulligans version of weep and the fireworks went on display in  carrots for robert a sax tribute to johnny hodges there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group unfortunately blakey doesnt choose to work much of the time in this vein he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like what we did get however was impressive a few drops of rain just before midnight when sarah vaughan was in the midst of her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listeners didnt care whether they got wet miss vaughan was back in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time like a fine wine after the spate of female vocalists we have been having all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever jazz three open program the evening program was opened by the jazz three a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass jack warner drums and don cook piano this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group also local talent went on first putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux it prevents latecomers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set but as the emergency accompanists for al minns  leon james the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program julie wilson sings julie wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as hardhearted hannah the vamp of savannah and the delightful sunday she frosted the cake with the always reliable bill bailey from this taste of the s we leaped way out to stan getzs private brand of progressive jazz which did lovely subtle things for baubles bangles and beads and a couple of ballards getz is a difficult musician to categorize he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over in this he is sticking with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be shearing takes over george shearing took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of vibes guitar bass drums shearings piano and a bongo drummer he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo shearing himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances a very casual pleasant program one of those easygoing things that make newports afternoon programs such a relaxing delight was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach divided almost equally into two parts it consisted of the evolution of the blues narrated by jon hendricks who had presented it last year at the monterey calif jazz festival and an hourlong session of maynard ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band hendricks story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west indies he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches surprise addition to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had big miller as a preachersinger and hannah dean gospelsinger while oscar brown jr an extremely talented young man did a slave auctioneers call a fieldhands work song and a beautifully sung negro lullaby brown baby which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival one of those delightful surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones drumming to old man river which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this years concerts demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues was michael babatunde olatunji who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of last years afternoon concerts hendricks had billy mitchell tenor sax pony poindexter alto sax jimmy witherspoon blues singer and a good one and the ike isaacs trio which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical examples it all went very well pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in schuberts sonatas music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example played for rca by emil gilels he has chosen sonata op  in d the playing takes both sides of the disc perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold ones attention with the gilels playing his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully the male chorus of the robert shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style the group is superbly trained what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question do you say chantey as if the word were derived from the french word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the frenchcanadian use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as a boatyard i say chantey either way the robert shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one the london label offers an operatic recital by ettore bastianini a baritone whose fame is international murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work signal and the repetition of an earlier one journal signal is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais its abstract decor is by john hultberg program note reads as follows take hands  this urgent visage beckons us here as in journal mr louis has given himself the lions share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements indeed both journal and signal qualify as instructive catalogues of moderndance calisthenics but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development it may be of course that mr louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation but it may be also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time one thing is certain however and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be  an american journey a brisk satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitled an american journey was given its first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night by the helen tamirisdaniel nagrin dance company choreographed by mr nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris once upon a time  as well as her womens song and mr nagrins indeterminate figure eugene lester assembled a witty and explicit score for an american journey and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes mr nagrin has described four places each with its scenery and people added two diversions and concluded with a toccata for the young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rocknroll dancing the places could be anywhere the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybodys and the laugh is on us all but we need not mind too much because mr nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way miss tamiris once upon a time  is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time the music here russell smiths tetrameron sounded good all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with mr nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape the symphony of the air greatly assisted by van cliburn last night got its sevenconcert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twentyfive programs at carnegie and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each of them in five different communities this news announced by jerome toobin the orchestras administrative director brought applause from the  persons who filled the hall they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains the details of the suburban concerts next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced later mr toobin said  the concertos that van cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return from russia in  have been the tchaikovsky the rachmaninoff third and the prokofieff third it was pleasant last night therefore to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded the emperor the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him but they were not what distinguished his performance the elements that did were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo mr cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of broodinf poetic mystery the collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too  mr wallenstein who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the leonore overture no  and the fourth symphony the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb  there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the overall development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit yet there is the classic case of the gershwins the man i love deemed too static when it was first heard in lady be good in philadelphia in  it was dropped from the score it was heard again in philadelphia in  in the first version of strike up the band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of strike up the band in  still another song in strike up the band ive got a crush on you was retrieved from a  failure treasure girl second chance like the gershwins richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them if one of mr rodgers melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure mr hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show several of these double entries have been collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney along with rodgers and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard rodgers and hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing album rodgers and hart revisited spruce records  fifth avenue new york among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of the garrick gaieties an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that followed dorothy loudons raucous listing of the attractions at the roxy music hall from i married an angel and the incisive style with which charlotte rae delivers the topdrawer hart lyrics of i blush a song that was cut from a connecticut yankee altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists norman paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompanimen turning to the current musical season on broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals how to succeed in business without really trying has been transferred to an original cast album r c a victor loc  stereo lso  that has some entertaining moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect robert morse singing with comically plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank loessers score rudy vallee who shares star billing with mr morse makes only two appearances he shares with mr morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice in general mr loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer like mr loesser jerry herman is both composer and lyriist for milk and honey r c a victor loc  stereo lso  but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel mr herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles resourceful voices there are the fullbodied resourceful voices of robert weede mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the most of mr hermans lilting melodies and for an occasional change of pace the bright humor of molly picon mr herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms not content to create only the music and lyrics noel coward also wrote the book and directed sail away capitol wao  stereo swao  a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr cowards more memorable works the melodies flow along pleasantly as mr cowards songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cuttoafamiliarpattern quality elaine stritch who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr cowards songs with three fine russian films in recent months on world war ii the house i live in the cranes are flying and ballad of a soldier we had every right to expect a real soviet blockbuster in the day the war ended it simply isnt not by a long shot the artkino presentation with english titles opened on saturday at the cameo theatre  make no mistake this gorky studio drama is a respectable import aptly grave carefully written performed and directed in describing the initial allied occupation of a middlesized german city the picture has color pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple at both sides of the conflicts aftermath unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this romance at the expense of everything else tenderly and rather tediously the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they dont want to hurt its the old story war or no war and more than one viewer may recall hollywoods titanic several seasons back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante not that the picture is superficial under yakov segals direction it begins stirringly as crouching soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first surrender gesture one highup camera shot is magnificent as the germans straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square and drop their weapons ring of bright water by gavin maxwell  pages dutton  only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience ring of bright water by gavin maxwell is just that a haunting warmly personal chronicle of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands he has married me with  a ring of bright water begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys the place is camusfearna the site of a longvanished seavillage opposite the isle of skye it is a land of long fjords few people a singlelane road miles away and of wild stags greylag geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna his furnishing the empty house with beachdrift the subtle changes in season over ten years is a moving experience just the evocations of time and place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost would be enough but it isnt there is mijbil an otter who travelled with maxwell and gave maxwells name to a new species from the tigris marshes to his london flat it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature this is not only a compliment to mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cubs journey by plane from iraq to london then by train where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap to camusfearna with affectionate detail mij as his owner was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needlesharp teeth he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow systematically he would open and ransack drawers given a small ball or marbles he would invent games and play by himself for hours with curiosity and elan he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventyfoot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell who nearly lost his life in doing so a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted but selfdiscovery as well in the solitude of camusfearna there had been no loneliness to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness  a sharpening of the senses now with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need that of being trusted implicitly by some creature two other people in time shared mijbils love  it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water  we were his trinity and he behaved towards us  with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation in turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his worship yet the idyll ended the brief details of mijbils death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy man to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man but then through a strange coincidence maxwell manages to acquire idal a female otter and the fascinating story starts once more one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book mijbil with his rollicking ways or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid and unabashed this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement now gavin maxwells ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world new york  the performances of the comedie francaise are the most important recent events in the new york theater they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the th century on the contrary the old plays are continually being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie of course the wellreceived revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance but they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic in france novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put molieres characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results so far as i know the comedie has never put molieres people in the costumes of the th century but they do reinterpret plays and characters last season the comedies two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racines phedre and molieres school for wives the new phedre was done in th century setting instead of ancient greek perhaps that is the comedies equivalent for thrusting this plays characters into our own time the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of th century elegance a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent the new school for wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character among the moliere specialists of some years ago louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while fernand ledoux often performing at the comedie made them more gross than moliere may have intended apparently jouvet and ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in the school for wives i say apparently although i saw jouvet as arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death by that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy arnolphe it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wifetobe the part can lend itself to serious treatment one influential french critic remarked pity for arnolphe comes with age accordingly at the comedie last year jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly wisely the comedie has brought molieres tartuffe on its tour and has left the school for wives at home tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactors wife jouvet played him as a sincere zealot and ledoux at the comedie made him a gross buffoon or so the historians tell us louis seigner who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux is the tartuffe of the present production which he himself directed his tartuffe observes the golden mean his red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation occasionally seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another the whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts his normal specialty is playing the goodnatured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness seigner is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service in that function he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie we are often told that the comedie has unfortunately lifecontracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company among his other parts are the leads in the bourgeois gentleman and the imaginary invalid in molieres farce the tricks of scapin robert hirsch undertakes another of the great roles here some innovation is attempted to begin with scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master hirschs scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world and surely his scapin has a fresh directness a nononsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobodys servant django reinhardt the illfated gypsy was a true artist one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesnt owe something to django and django owed much to louis armstrong he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records he bought in the flea market in paris it was the first jazz he had heard django who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who died in  in france was an extraordinary man most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz you can catch up with him if you havent already on rcavictors album djangology made up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france this is a choice item and grappely deserves mention too of course he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin they play minor swing honeysuckle

trombonist chicken farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember good time jazz has released a nice tworecord album which he made he is starred against alvin alcorn trumpet phil gomez clarinet cedric haywood piano

fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the oldtime jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems mischa elman shared last nights lewisohn stadium concert with three american composers his portion of the program and a big portion it was consisted of half the major nineteenthcentury concertos for the violin to wit the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky that is an evening of musicmaking that would faze many a younger man mr elman is  years old there were  persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard elman but with all due respects and allowances it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet more mannered than musical the occasion was sentimental so was the playing  the american part of the evening consisted of paul crestons dance overture william schumans chester from new england triptych and two works of wallingford riegger dance rhythms op  and a romanza for strings op a the creston is purely a potboiler with spanish english french and american dances mixed into the stew the riegger with its latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale like his sweet attractive romanza it belongs to what the composer called his nondissonant mostly category of works the schuman chester takes off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect  all these potboilers or no provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great outofdoors it was nice to have something a little uptodate for a change we have alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of a question of adultery yesterdays new british import at the apollo since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise the films extensive discussion of the problem seems at best superfluous in its present artless lowbudget form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath with julie london enacting the central role with huskyvoiced sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident anthony steel as the husband is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action adulterous the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of don chaffey as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton diffring as an innocent bystander after a protracted hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility the jury to no ones surprise leaves the legal question unresolved when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place so was the audience london july   for its final change of bill in its london season the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the royal opera house covent garden no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased and please it did in every sense of the word for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences at the end of the program indeed there was a demonstration that lasted for fortyfive minutes and nothing could stop it alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number taras bulba but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all only a plea from the house manager john collins finally broke up the party  but for all the manifest intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company the taras bulba excerpt is a rousing version of gogols ukrainian folktale choreographed by bo fenster to music of solovievsedoi it is danced by some thirtyfive men and no women and it contains everything in the books lusty comedy gregarious cavorting and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human body perform yuri soloviev oleg sokolov alexei zhitkov lev sokolov yuri korneyev and mr livshitz were the chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent  at the other extreme in character was the halfhour excerpt from the petipaminkus ballet bayaderka which opened the evening what a man this petipa was and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets this scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed loves spirit among twentyeight extraordinarily beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human which of course is altogether fitting the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness and adagio is the general medium of the piece  its ballerina olga moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and ludmilla alexeyeva inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments sergei vikulov as the lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the work is designed to belong to the ladies the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal merit but all of them pretty good at that they consisted of a new arrangement of nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by irina kolpakova and mr sokolev with a large ensemble a winning little snow maiden variation by the adorable galina kekisheva two of those poetic adagios in greek veils and superb esthetic acrobacy by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other an amusing character pas de cinq called gossiping women a stirring flames of paris pas de deux by xenia terstepanova and alexandre pavlovsky and a lovely version of fokines le cygne by olga moiseyeva which had to be repeated vadim kalentiev was the conductor it was quite an evening a year ago today when the democrats were fretting and frolicking in los angeles and john f kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the presidency theodore h white had already compiled masses of notes about the presidential campaign of  as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated mr white took more notes he traveled alternately with mr kennedy and with richard m nixon he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates ingroups he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general as well as about the daytoday course of the closest presidential election in american history those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by mr white in the making of the president  this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one what might have been only warmedover topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history mr white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter his zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book a lesson in politics as a dramatic narrative the making of the president  is continuously engrossing and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational the author begins this volume with a closeup of mr kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls five democrats senator hubert h humphrey senator stuart symington senator lyndon b johnson adlai e stevenson and mr kennedy and two republicans governor rockefeller and mr nixon then in chronological order mr white covers the primary campaigns the conventions and the presidential campaign itself in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race religion local tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television mr white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horses mouth from numerous insiders and from mr kennedy himself but never from mr nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less says mr white mr nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man mr nixon mr white believes ignored his own toplevel planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television mr nixon is a broody moody man given to long stretches of introspection he trusts only himself and his wife  he is a man of major talent but a man of solitary uncertain impulses  he was above all a friend seeker almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them  the least inspiring candidate since alfred m landon mr kennedy mr white believes had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him calm dignified composed superbly eloquent mr kennedy always knew everything about everybody he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers every decision was made quickly on sound grounds efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance mr kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters mr white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr kennedy to be a fine president pressures portrayed throughout the making of a president mr white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play key roles and he makes many interesting comments here are several the root question in american politics is always whos the man to see to understand american politics is simply to know people to know the relative weight of names who are heroes who are straw men who controls who does not but to operate in american politics one must go a step further one must build a bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion all platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium which had begun with the appearance of the yearold mischa elman on tuesday night continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts miss pons is certainly not no singer ever is and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments the better part of gallantry might be perhaps to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbowhued gown and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing no orchestra however could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night in all fairness there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate vocalism  one such moment came in the breathtaking way miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeers shadow song the years suddenly fell away at this point on the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on sharing the program was the young frenchcanadian tenor richard verreau making his stadium debut on this occasion mr verreau began shakily with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume later on this problem vanished and the flower song from bizets carmen was beautifully and intelligently projected radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible the mushrooming of fm outlets offering concerts both jazz and classical lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners an audience which in the united states comprises some  people with  to spend each year of course the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials but the growing number of negroappeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects it is estimated that more than  stations of a total of  do a significant amount of programing for the negro at least  stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the  states these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers for  years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio in the past  years sponsor observes these trends have become apparent  negro population in the us has increased  per cent while the white population was growing by  per cent the forgotten  million as sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey has become a betterremembered  million  advertisers are changing their attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it  stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational economic and cultural levels futhermore the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects not simply serve on the air in the last decade the number of negroappeal radio program hours has risen at least  per cent and the number of negroappeal stations has increased  per cent according to a research man quoted by sponsor a year ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which the odd member stations are sure will bring in more business the  census underscored the explosive character of the population growth it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the us negroes live outside the southeastern states also the state with the largest number of negroes is new york not in the south at all in new york city wlib boasts more community service programs than any other negro station and one of the largest negro news staffs in america and wwrls colorful mobile unit cruising predominately negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder of that stations roundtheclock dedication to nonwhite interests recently wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit a halfdozen other stations in the new york area also bid for attention of the citys negro population up about  per cent in the past decade in all big cities outside the south and even in small towns within the south radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners the keystone broadcasting systems negro network includes  affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total us negro population one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status whatever the longrange impact of integration the owners of negroappeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only from a fact sheet what sets negroappeal programing apart from other radio shows sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers rhythmandblues mood music race music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs furthermore news and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects and personalities rarely mentioned on a generalappeal station advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendonebony station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious of quality and and does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio programs famous the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j walter carroll of ksan san francisco negroappeal radio is more important to the negro today because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements and desires it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation presentation of the life and times of john sloan in the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artists widow helen farr sloan to the wilmington society of the fine arts the exhibition presents a survey of sloans work from early family portraits painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year  and still part of his estate few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness the paintings drawings prints and illustrations all reflect the manners costumes and mores of america in the first half of the present century obviously sloans early years were influenced by his close friend robert henri as early as  however the sloan style began to change the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes the exhibition presents all phases of sloans manysided art in addition to the paintings are drawings prints and illustrations sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of new york thereby building for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorleys saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is sun and wind on the roof with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds although there are landscapes in the show one of the strongest is a vista of gloucester harbor in  the human element was the compelling factor in sloans art significant are such canvases as bleeker street saturday night with its typically american crowd sloan never went abroad the multifigure traveling carnival in which action is vivified by lighting or carmine theater  the only canvas with an ash can and foraging dog although sloan was a member of the famous eight and of the socalled ashcan school a term he resented not all the paintings however are of cities the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the southwest koshare in the dust a vigorous indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette the fact that sloan was an extrovert concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle there are  items in the wilmington show including one painting by each member of the eight as well as work by sloans friends and students supplementing the actual art are memorabilia correspondence diaries books from the artists library etc all belong to the collection being given to wilmington over a period of years by mrs sloan who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at the art students league new york in the s to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries the delaware art center according to its director bruce st john will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works as well as a card index file the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians the current exhibition which remains on view through oct  has tapped  major collections and many private sources any musician playing beethoven here where beethoven was born is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care in a sense he is offering bonn what its famous son who left as a youth never did the sound of the composers mature style robert riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded rd beethoven festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the style his readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative without being presumptuous the  c minor variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline the d minor sonata op  no  introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasirecitative single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of opera style of which beethoven was genuinely capable but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging two late sonatas op  and  were played with similar insight the disarming simplicities of the op  adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious the two were separated from each other by the six bagatelles of op  herr riefling in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority volker wangenheim who conducted bonns stadtisches orchester on the following evening made one more conscious of the process of interpretation herr wangenheim has only recently become the citys music director and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium but he weighted the eighth symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music he might have been hoping to all appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program could amount to something like the ninth but no amount of headtossing could make it so the conductors preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed it did so with plenty of spring the concertos soloist hans richterhaaser played with compensatory ease and economy though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by herr riefling his was a burgomasters beethoven solid and sensible everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano chorus and orchestra in c minor made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs the entrance of the stadtisches gesangverein bonns civic chorus was worth all the waiting however as the young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life the last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories brought the cologne rundfunksinfonieorchester and rundfunkchor to bonns goldfilled hall for a performance of the missa solemnis a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise this theory eventually proved inexact but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science it is the business of cosmologists the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge in the autumn of  the british broadcasting corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator the participants were professor h bondi professor of mathematics at kings college london dr w b bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college london dr r a lyttleton a lecturer at st johns college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge and dr g j whitrow reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology london dr whitrow functioned as moderator the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called rival theories of cosmology dr bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on the general theory of relativity first of all and this has been calculated by observation the universe is expanding that is the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds because of this dr bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years expands and contracts dr bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in then after many more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again professor bondi disagrees with the expansioncontraction theory he supports the steadystate theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space for this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies if this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding for new galaxies to be created professor bondi declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years he contends this idea doesnt conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments dr lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen the basic building block of matter the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr lyttleton is not so sure suppose says dr lyttleton the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron so slight it is presently immeasurable this would give the hydrogen atom a slight chargeexcess now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the chargeexcess of all those atoms in the sphere because electrical forces the chargeexcess are far more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere dr lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe fleeting glimpse this slim book while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has several photographs and charts of galaxies help the nonscientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a manmade satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science presently the intense absorption of ultraviolet rays in the earths atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earths gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a longsought ladder from which to peer at alien regions in doing away with the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos and although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man roots the new play at the brandnew mayfair theater on th st which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl highly successful in england before its transfer to new york most of roots is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy only in its final scene where beatie bryant mary doyle shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and onehalf acts the burden of mr weskers message is that people living close to the soil at least in england are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people citybred intellectuals imagine rather they are genuine clods proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought they care no more for politics says mr wesker than they do for a symphony seeming to have roots in the soil they actually have none in life they dwell in short in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr wesker dedicates to it so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer unless he has been living in a gilded palace perhaps and wants a real big heap of contrast the messy meals the washing of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such a thing as redundancy now for the good points miss doyle as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a warm smile she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie we never do see him and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating including a dose of good british socialism but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull he sends beatie a letter of dismissal beatie getting no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom despite a too long sustained declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by roots there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including william hansens impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic father and katherine squires vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin nonsense from her daughter or anyone else but i am afraid mr weskers meat and potatoes dish isnt well seasoned enough for local audiences shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain that disrupted wednesday nights much ado about nothing opening the season of free theatre in central park the new york shakespeare festival which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed began bravely joseph papp impassioned founder of the festival and director of much ado had a vibrant colorful production under way using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with shakespeares words in a spirited mixture the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised chuckles the simpleminded comedy of dogberry and verges also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers heads evoked laughter the vivacity of the masquers party at leonatos palace with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon cast a spell of delight  as much ado turned serious while the insipid claudio rejected hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall at first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas were opened but the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart the grieving hero and her father leonato followed by the friar left the stage a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes more than half the audience departed some remained in the wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads others huddled under the trees outside the fence twenty minutes after the interruption although it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped beatrice nan martin and benedick j d cannon took their places on the stage in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus had foreseen this moment said benedick lady beatrice have you wept all this while replied beatrice yea and i will weep a while longer the heavens refused to give up their weeping the gallant company completed act iv and got through part of act v but the final scenes could not be played if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort much ado ends happily  the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare one could hardly blame newbold morris the parks commissioner for devoting so much grateful mention to the departments technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains eldon elder who designed the stage also created a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and shakespeares lighthearted mood mr papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints still a demurrer or two must be entered schwarzkopf is of course schwarzkopf for style and assurance for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible put to the service of lieder of schubert brahms strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism instead of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical expression miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside the symptoms saturday night were unmistakable clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little too melodramatic there was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness there were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist john wustman often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them the dance dancers and dance enthusiasts  of them had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs on saturday the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved  there was additionally a bonus for the saturdaynight patrons alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first new york performance of mr aileys roots of the blues a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival otherwise the program included as on thursday the tarastchaikovsky design for strings the dollarbritten divertimento the dollarde banfield the duel and the pas de deux from the nutcracker maria tallchief and erik bruhn who danced the nutcracker pas de deux were also seen in the petipaminkus pas de deux from don quixote another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in their roles in the duel a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants mr aileys roots of the blues an earthy and very human modern dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening  as brother john sellers sang five blues to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep shepard mr ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and ecstatic their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm fan he wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress the catlike sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes almost frightening tensions roots of the blues may not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its supercharged impact perhaps it is better to stay at home the armchair traveler preserves his illusions this somewhat cynical comment may be found in blue skies brown studies a collection of travel essays by william sansom who would never consider staying home for long mr sansom is english bearded formidably cultivated the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell mr sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty her third and an american multimillionaire his fourth the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices there are sixteen essays in blue skies brown studies most of them were written between  and  and originally appeared in various magazines all are well written and are overwritten but even if mr sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and astound too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another mr sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references a contemplative connoisseur i like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells and looks like its color its particular kind of life this is an exact description of what mr sansom does he ignores guidebook facts he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions it is an overall impression mr sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london vienna the french riviera and the norwegian fjords but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions a writer lives at best in a state of astonishment he says beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all to transmit that feeling he writes this may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of mr sansom so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st torpetius that still persists in st tropez at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city at the supreme delights to be found in one of the worlds finest restaurants la bonne auberge which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport and at the infinite variety of london mr sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls to those who recall easily the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto he can coin a neat phrase a street spattered with an invigoration of people tulips with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniels ears after a snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity and for all his lacquered almost byzantine selfconsciousness he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison beauty borrowed from afar in one of his best essays mr sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr sansom reminds us thus the white colonnaded cedarroofed southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of greyskied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza the old mind of andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips nice even if a trifle gaudy blue skies brown studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio wbai the listenersupported outlet on the frequencymodulation band has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void yesterday it offered poised for violence by jean reavey wbai is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate unfortunately poised for violence was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point  mrs reaveys work is written for the stage it is mentioned for an offbroadway production in the fall and in addition employs an avantgarde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged the plays device is to explore societys obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artists models who remain part of someone elses painting rather than just be themselves in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty  somewhere in mrs reaveys play there is both protest and aspiration of merit but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listeners stamina begins to wilt moreover her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankinds ills but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the authors words which in itself is an immediate reward of the wbai experiment good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration a weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month titled whats new in music the enterprising program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station wqxr the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze the show is programed and written by the stations assistant continuity editor chuck briefer the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings last saturdays interesting melange included ernst toch karlheinz stockhausen richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new space opera by the swedish composer karlbirger blomdahl other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american composer a particular type of music or the music of a given country it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene but one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of the alltoobrief excerpt from the blomdahl opera that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybodys heart it is good to see those numbers again the suite of old russian dances that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth the amusing yurochka in which a hardtoplease young man is given his comeuppance the lovely and of course vigorous polyanka or the meadow the three moldavian dances entitled zhok the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called bulba and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called city quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been and they are welcome back so for that matter are the newer dances the kalmuk dance with its animal movements that genial juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called the platter the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called summer the three shepherds of azerbaijan hopping

year ago it was bruited that the primary character in erich maria remarques new novel was based on the marquis alfonso de portago the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia automobile race of  if this was in fact mr remarques intention he has achieved a notable failure clerfayt of heaven has no favorites resembles portago only in that he is male and a racedriver quite a bad racedriver whereas portago was a good one he is a dull unformed and aimless person the twelfth marquis de portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate one looked forward to mr remarques ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised unhappily heaven has no favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list mr remarques conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knifeedge between death from tuberculosis and recovery his treatment of it is something else his heroine chooses to die the price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being higher than she wishes to pay her lover precedes her in death at the wheel and presumably he too has chosen between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement mr remarque has laid down many pages of juniorphilosophical discourse some demure and rather fetching lovemaking pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe and a modicum of automobile racing the ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing the lovemaking perhaps because it is pale and lowkey when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is often charming the automobile racing bears little relation to reality this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn clerfayt as say a tournament golfer hazards to life and limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant racedrivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously mr remarques intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes he does not the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal the book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing the necessity is not clear to me and in any case to present a casehardened racedriver as saying he has left his car which or whom he calls giuseppe parked on the place vendome sneering at a dozen bentleys and rollsroyces parked around him is not a liberty it is an absurdity but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of the book that remarques failure is plainest clerfayt is neurotic preoccupied and passive to be human he believes is to seek ones own destruction the freudian deathwish cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto racedrivers in point of fact the racedrivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit a portago could say as he did say to me if i die tomorrow still i have had twentyeight wonderful years but i shant die tomorrow ill live to be  clerfayt transported may think of the engine driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood the italian master piero taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a cars adhesion to a wet twolane road at  miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae clerfayt driving sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell the briton stirling moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all time believes that ultrafast roadcircuit driving is an art form related to ballet errors in technical terminology suggest that the overall translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr remarque hoped to tell us however my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of racedrivers pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machinemasters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists the west is leaderless according to this book in contrast the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev tito and mao against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all it is field marshal montgomerys belief that in most western countries about  per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity about  per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable and only the last  per cent are genuine christians and believers in democracy but these western countries do care about themselves each feels intensely national if say the russians intended to stop tom jones going to the pub then tom jones would fight the commies but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it such as cause for all practical purposes the west stands disunited undedicated and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership with this barrage montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the west never given to mincing words he places heavy blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america at wars end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the labour government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state with britain looking inward overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united states montgomery believes that she started well america gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike she pushed wartorn and povertystricken nations into prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace america has divided more than she has united the west the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked however she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed but the greater reason for fumbling stumbling american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor they are determined montgomery writes not to be surprised again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary but also creates nervousness  among other nations in the western alliance not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad to monty the american people who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war  as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be relied upon to lead the path to leadership is made clear montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the wests own house in order such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the united states namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany that the east german government does not exist that events in japan in june  were communistinspired that the true government of china is in formosa that mao was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may  and that either china or russia wants or expects war such a leader must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity about which it has always talked after drastically overhauling nato western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the east and west major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by  the west should make the central proposal but the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle he alone has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach a decision but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring frances lost soul whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership the leader montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency and be honest and morally proper all in all montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him  in looking as far back as moses thence to cromwell napoleon lincoln churchill and nehru montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for hitlers war however montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene like eisenhower he holds the militarists suspicion of politicians however at the same time montgomery selects as his hero de gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support for the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts nevertheless montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events it is no common thing for a listener critical or otherwise to hear a singer live for the first time only after he has died but then mario lanza was no common singer and his whole career public and nonpublic was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital only when he has ceased to be a living voice it is a kind of justice too that it should originate in londons royal albert hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate rca victor lm   to be sure lanza made numerous concert tours here and abroad but these did not take him to new york where the carping critic might lurk the reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving public the horseplaying public all these and others fill substantial roles in us life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating public the department of agriculture averaged out us food consumption last year at  lbs per person which allowing for the  million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down  lbs or more a day that mother hen of the weightheight tables the metropolitan life insurance co clucks that  million americans are overweight through previous centuries eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just getting enough now big forces buffet food for the first time in history the us has produced a society in which less than onetenth of the people turn out so much food that the governments most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of  million tons of surplus farm produce in this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only onefifth his income buy more calories than he can consume refrigeration automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health to eat is human the nation is learning to think to survive divine fads facts h not all the concern for health is well directed from the fusty panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the us has progressed to curds concentrates and capsules each year reports the american medical association ten million americans spend  million on vitamins tonics and other food supplements at juice bars in los angeles  health stores a new sensation is a pink highprotein cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherryflavored nocal which sells for  per oz glass grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health and a big group of us scientists wants to supply them the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university of minnesotas physiologist ancel keys  inventor of the wartime k for keys ration and author of last years bestselling eat well and stay well from his birchpaneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene under the universitys football stadium in minneapolis we get a rumble on every touchdown blocky greyhaired dr keys directs an ambitious ayear experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing pursuing it he has logged  miles suffered indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected physiological data on the

calories should contain  and extra weight increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack  americans eat too much fat with meat milk butter and ice cream the calorieheavy us diet is  fat and most of that is saturated fat the insidious kind says dr keys that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary disease obesity a malnutrition throughout much of the world food is still so scarce that half of the earths population has trouble getting the  calories a day necessary to sustain life the deficiency diseases scurvy tropical sprue pellagra run rampant in

regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin says keys maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral the fat man would start to think morals aside the fat man has plenty to worry about over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him the simple mechanical strain of overweight says new yorks dr norman jolliffe can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher

psychological compulsion it may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity or in children simply by the desire to stop an anxious mothers nagging some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment the result says jolliffe the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life food may act as a sedative giving temporary emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does reports dr keys a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more he may be interested in another woman or just like being with the boys so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake its a matter of boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something because shes being deprived of something else for the army of compulsive eaters from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines benzedrine dexedrine as dangerous crutches for a weak will keys has no such objections to metrecal quaker oatss quota and other calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters metrecal is a pretty complete food he says it contains large amounts of protein vitamins and minerals in the quantity of  calories a day anyone will lose weight on it   or  lbs but keys worries that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food that remarkable cholesterol despite his personal distaste for obesity disgusting dr keys has only an incidental interest in how much americans eat what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nations no  killer coronary artery disease which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills  americans a year twice the toll from all varieties of cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents cholesterol the cornerstone of dr keyss theory is a mysterious yellowish waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol scientists assume that cholesterol from the greek chole meaning bile and sterios meaning solid is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells since it accounts for about  of the brains total solid weight they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver although the fatty protein molecules carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the body a remarkable substance says dr keys quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries when thus deposited keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks explains keys as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery the proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left behind as cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation eventually says keys one of two things happens a clot forms at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack or more commonly thinks keys the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the arterys flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured fats  coronaries ordinarily the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the bodys needs for transportation of fats and for production of bile even eggs and other cholesterolrich foods eaten in normal amounts says dr keys do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood but fatty foods do during world war ii doctors in the netherlands and scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping not until long after the war  in fact did they get a hint of the reason that year swedens haqvin malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods that same year the university of californias dr laurance kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to rise here keys and others such as dr a e ahrens of the rockefeller institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats and even between different varieties of each all natural food fats fall into one of three categories saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens monounsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule and the polyunsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens the three fats have similar caloric values about  calories per oz but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments merger proposed however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation wards protected the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan  the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ask jail deputies on other matters the jury recommended that  four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail  fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department mayor william b hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife pearl williams hartsfield in fulton superior court friday his petition charged mental cruelty the couple was married aug   they have a son william berry jr and a

reelection georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the  governors race a top official said wednesday robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept  in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken  five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or  the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform sam caldwell state highway department public relations

urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment vandiver likely will mention the  million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item construction bonds meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first  million worth of highway reconstruction bonds the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some  million to  million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work a revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities vandiver opened his race for governor in  with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of  million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a  per day increase in expense allowances pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through  a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of  as of sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past rep mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds barber who is in his th year as a legislator said there are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it the resolution passed but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises colquitt  after a long hot controversy miller county has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election i ever saw in this county the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee davis received  votes in saturdays election and bush got  ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said being at the polls was just like being at church i didnt smell a drop of liquor and we didnt have a bit of trouble the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however it was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence the former county school superintendent george p callan shot himself to death march  four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board during the election campaign both candidates davis and bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls ordinary williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise everything went real smooth the sheriff said there wasnt a bit of trouble austin texas  committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce  million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of  million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug  he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said you take out of circulation many millions of dollars rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday austin texas  senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of  or more population require deaf children between  and  years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here

berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected were getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also im willing to stake my political career on it rep berry an exgambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later  the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities  the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar one validated acts of school districts another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted  without dissent senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site  two tax revision bills were passed one by sen louis crump of san saba would aid more than  retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a  fine it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research

goal of international understanding the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit finally mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington this statement recalls the  berlin crisis when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded expresidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words some of former president trumans offthecuff discourses have been in that vein nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility this is a matter of respect for the presidency mr eisenhowers new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship queen of the seas the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high seas reports that the venerable liner which has been in service since  was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us but the cunard line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least a new queen with the prosaic title of q had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary the british government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling  toward the  cost of a new ton passenger liner since  more and more transatlantic passengers have been crossing by air economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines competition from other steamship lines has cut cunards share of sea passengers from onethird to onefourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than  tons this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation mission to viet nam gen maxwell taylors statement in saigon that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the prowestern government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army gen taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military economic political and other resources there was good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis south viet nams rice surplus for next year more than  tons may have been destroyed the viet cong the communist rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november nothing that is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in  when gen ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of  to  divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing it is a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops he may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming south viet nam has received  in united states aid since  and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnsons visit last may gen taylor the presidents special military adviser is a levelheaded officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass gov john m dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained not because of their legal talents but because of their government influence the u ns gravest crisis ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u ns problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the institution has faced of course it is if the decision goes wrong it may be as mr stevenson fears the first step on the slippery path downhill to a u n without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the organization in other words the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one he should be as dag hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the world the charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible the united states and its allies have had no objection to this what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjolds death to turn the entire u n staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly around the nature of his relationship with them although the united states and the u s s r have been arguing whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary generals decisions the nature of the organization will have changed if they give him advice when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction the nature of the u n will not of necessity change the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone elses instructions this is the root issue for which the united states should stand we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography what we must have if the united nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject to no single nations direction and subservient to no single nations ambition what the new charter does the new city charter which should get a yes vote as question no  on nov  would not make a good mayor out of a bad one there is no such magic in manmade laws but it would greatly strengthen any mayors executive powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate increase his budgetmaking authority both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor thus there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative the board is diminished in both respects while it retains control over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment of property and other trusteeship functions the board will be able to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the mayors veto but the city council will now share fully this budgetaltering power overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council and a twothirds vote the controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed he loses nowmisplaced tax collection duties which go to the finance department on net balance in spite of controller gerosas opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now borough presidents while retaining membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions highways go to a new department of highways sewers to the department of public works such street cleaning as borough presidents now do in queens and richmond to the sanitation department some fiscal changes are important the expense operating budget is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy with the mayor approving in fund transfers within a department the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises but as a secondlook safeguard each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business it will also correct some injustices enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow interamerican press the interamerican press association which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years the i a p a is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime more and more cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced into exile the i a p a found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batistas dictatorship began in  freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances in such conditions all freedoms are lost this in more diplomatic language is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government he felt able to end on a note of hope he sees evidence of fair winds for the tenyear alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the interamerican press association meeting in moscow the twentysecond soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced according to the original program premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage depending upon individual or national politics because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by  the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russias progress painted by the communist partys program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchevs berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered whether it is or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for  they and their children must first survive this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job dr conants call to action dr james b conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change now a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york has shattered this optimism dr conant has come away shocked and angry his new book entitled slums and suburbs calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr conants specific views his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open or permissive enrollment dr conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend but these are side issues to a powerful central theme that theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and doubletalk it labels the slums especially the negro slums as deadend streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike the facts he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of the color of their students a call for action before it is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who in his previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme measures these warnings must not be treated lightly dr conants conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nations gratitude he has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools and now more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive socalled junk mail he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses or even zone numbers in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district this means an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis  our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly typewritten most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a

requisitioned  he said he had no s enough to last two weeks more threat of closing the cannery is a recent one a threeman committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed reason the cannery loses  yearly but dekalb citizens those who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed to make any money the cannery said mrs lewellyn lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of  to handle the victory garden produce is a service to the taxpayer and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant grow vegetables and put them up it helps those people who help themselves the county though seems more interested in those people who dont even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food a driver of a dairy truck who begins work at  am finishes before breakfast then goes out and grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five asked what in the world will we do what in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes the tomatoes will any of us do moss a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county doesnt believe it will close but he is in the middle an employe of dekalb but on the side of the people the young married people the old couples the dairy truck driver the old woman with the stew dont ask me if i think the cannery helps he said sir i know the cannery helps most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it there is one thing i know a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades several years ago i was his pastor one night at the close of the evening service he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land we tried to settle this dispute he said but could never come to an agreement i settled it tonight he continued i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in your heart henry van dyke said forgive and forget if you can but forgive anyway jesus made three things clear about forgiveness we must first of all be willing to forgive others before we can secure gods forgiveness for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses matthew  it will do no good to seek gods forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong then jesus indicated that gods forgiveness is unlimited in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words forgive us our debts when a person meets gods requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven gods mercy and patience will last forever forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by gods love it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past we want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future finally we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us once peter asked how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven matthew  jesus not only taught forgiveness he gave us an example of it on the cross with all the energy of his broken body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what they do luke  shes been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although shes still a teenager who looks like a baby she is getting married her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish said for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldnt have made myself heard if id had the equivalent of the message to garcia but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female six girls sprawled on one bed drinking cokes and giggling she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute how do you know you love somebody enough to get married she asked it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure arent you sure i asked looking at her searchingly i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important but if she were just having a normal case of prenuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage besides in all honesty i dont know how you can be sure i dont know any secret recipe for certainty in the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth does he ever bore you i asked bore me she was shocked oh noo why hes so darling and  i mean i went on ruthlessly when hes not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love is he interesting does he care about things that matter to you can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating because honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage long periods when youre hopelessly stranded together and if you bore each other then heaven help you she came back the other day to reassure me she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting she asked if i had other advice and heady with success i rushed it in i hope not too late be friends with your motherinlaw jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothersinlaw make good friends i do not know dr wilson sneed well but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st lukes church in atlanta it was the cry of not just one heart it spoke for many in the clergy i suspect the pulpit is a lonely place who stops to think of that imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments he told his members a minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote  for he becomes ordinary    and so the young minister resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he told his parishioners when i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self but oh how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards  yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word and gods we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week american cash if we break the minister to our bit we are buying back our own sins if he wont break we add to the stress he bears and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to we expect him to be noble and to make us so yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be we expect bestowal of gods love through him but how little love we give him the church truly is not a rest home for saints but a hospital for sinners yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers too mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure the evening was not always spent in the same way this year on a night cool with the front of september moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages in the midst of it all mr podger came out on the pod porch alone he had that day attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize the prize was an oldfashioned woven cloth hammock complete with crosstop pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging mrs podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was slung in a vineshaded corner the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement mr podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him suddenly one young voice rose above the others but it said do you always know when youre happy the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question stayed in mr podgers mind here in the cool autumntouched evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace  it had begun with the blue jay feather walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight the winging spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet all day long mr podger who was a strawhat man in the summer had worn the feather in the band of his broadbrimmed sunshield would a blue feather in a mans hat make him happy all day hardly but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake then since the auction was being held nearby he had walked to it and there on the way had been the box turtle that slow selfcontained worldignoring relic of prehistory bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road it was doing very well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car would the driver see the turtle would he take pains to avoid it mr podger took no chances taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its roadcrossing with what must have been a breathtaking suddenness the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon but mr podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other here in the cool darkness mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sunbrowned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight where was the driver now what was he doing and the turtle mr podger smiled for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama the three would never meet again but for some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember the incident then there had been the auction itself mr podger heard again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr podgers hammock purchase i like them things too he had said we got one at home you know what if youre lyin out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool you know you just take these sides with the fringe on see and wrap em right over you i do it lots o times i like to lie in a hammock at night by myself when its all quiet  the wind moves it a little bit you know   mr podger had thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon mr podger saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that the boy too was lying in a cool fringedwrapped quiet alacrity the podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly and mr podger took her inside the fringe soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod mr podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out dad she said its getting so chilly weve lighted a fire and were going to tell a round robin story a nice scary one we need you to start it why are you out here all by yourself arent you happy mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire of course i am he said never happier in my life i just came out here to know it dallas as the south begins another school year national and even world attention is directed at the regions slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities dallas and atlanta in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully the programs do not take sides on the issue itself they point out simply that it is the law of the land the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation even better they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs in each case there was an initial act of violence in nashville a school was dynamited in houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes none of which were serious in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents the nashville plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south it is a stairstep plan in which desegregation begins in the first grade each year another grade is added to the process until finally all  grades are integrated the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why not now the program has worked well in both nashville and houston it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program generally throughout the south there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas during the summer negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments it was part of a citywide move toward full integration so successful has been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that further extensions are expected in the next few months hotels for example are ready to let down the bars already at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously allwhite neighborhoods of dallas it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it there are many causes for this change one of the most important is economic business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of cooperation has sprung up this cooperation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation they realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation economic and otherwise since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago ive been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship played mostly on the freeways around los angeles it goes like this a driver cruising easily at  mph in lane a of a fourlane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b which is heavily populated by cars also moving at  mph the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him he can  point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a  slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes or  alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access whether or not this is done out of enlightened selfpreservation i dont know but it is done consistently and im both surprised and impressed  this could never happen in my native chicago there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood in chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back failing this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however does an injustice to southern california drivers at the risk of losing my chargeaplate at marshall field and company i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype after three months of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers ive ever encountered during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street miami fla march  an outoftown writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year now richards of course is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go he can often make the complex ridiculously simple and vice versa this happened to be vice versa but even so the answer was a masterpiece its a whole lot easier he said to increase the population of nevada than it is to increase the population of new york city and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote said the writer scratching his head now if i can just figure out what hes talking about ill use it two spots open this was just richards way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two spots left and right field are really up for grabs it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year but so far it hasnt worked that way this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one youd never guess it from the way theyve played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in  obviously if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement someplace where can that improvement possibly come from you certainly cant expect the infield to do any better than it did last year robby could be better brooks robinson is great and it is conceivable that hell do even better in  than he did in  you cant expect it though robbys performance last year was tremendous its the same with ron hansen and jim gentile if they do as well as they did in  there can be no complaint they shouldnt be asked to carry any more of the burden hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might very well set him back he got off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstances probably wont duplicate it there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year they dont expect to stop him just slow him down some with the bat hell still be a top player they concede because hes got a great glove and the long ball going for him but they expect to reduce his overall offensive production breeding might move up gentile can hardly do better than drive in  runs dont ask him more i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch but even so he had a good year in  and wont do too much better so all in all the infield cant be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first and the pitching will also have trouble doing better richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season where then can we look for improvement from triandos brandt and walker answers richards theyre the ones we can expect to do better the man is right and at this time indications are that these three are ready for better seasons triandos hasnt proved it yet but he says hes convinced his thumb is all right he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasnt bothered him if he can bounce back with one of those  home runs years the club will have to be better off offensively im still not convinced though ill have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him hank foiles backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant to me brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year he hasnt played too much because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice hes hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year when he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club he was down hard to talk to and far too nonchalant on the field as of now that all seems behind him hes been entirely different all spring and walker looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year let him bounce back and he could really set up the staff so if the orioles are to improve brandt triandos and walker will have to do it so far the platoons on left and right fielders dont seem capable of carrying the load of course this isnt taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city but its the way things look from here at this point is the mother of an autistic child at fault the autistic child is one who seems to lack a welldefined sense of self he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people did his mother make him this way some people believe she did we think differently we believe that autism like so many other conditions of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties sometimes she can to a large extent help him overcome them but we dont think she creates them we dont think she can make her child defective emotionally disturbed or autistic the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written for the layman wed like to share one experienced mothers comments she wrote total disinterest as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything i have to manipulate my sons fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy he wants me to do everything for him you dont believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them but i do and my psychiatrist does too i know that my son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned this is that autistic people dont enjoy physical contact with others for instance my children and i when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board he pushes and straightens himself as if he cant stand the feeling of being held physical contact is uncomforatble for him this mother is quite correct as a rule the autistic child doesnt enjoy physical contact with others parents have to find other ways of comforting him for the young child this may be no more than providing food light or movement as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object his magic thing or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick the answer is different for each autistic child but for most there is an answer only ingenuity will uncover it what future holds dear doctors we learned this year that our older son daniel is autistic we did not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to fortunately there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group of normal children i try to treat daniel as if he were normal though of course i realize he is far from that at present what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible what is your experience with autistic children how do they turn out later many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood singlecolor use question  a first grader colors pictures one solid color everything sky grass boy wagon etc when different colors are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green etc the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color should i show my daughter how things should be colored she is an aggressive nervous child is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits answer  her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade no coloring isnt exactly something you teach a child you sometimes give them a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to replace the onecolor look to which we have been accustomed just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme so may some of the newest versions of embroidery one such in fact is a rug though not actually crewel embroidery it has that look with its overstitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a sauterne background the twirled stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country the work is executed in england by hand and can be worked in any desired design and color among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were

amateur politico thomas b carvey jr whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircrafts moon missiles hes approached his democratic duties in hardnosed engineering fashion  viewed from afar the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups  or so much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every volunteer democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the cdc  moreover the entire state democratic hierarchy from gov brown on down to the county chairmen also participates in this huge operation contrarily republican volunteers go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication that theyd be willing to join forces under a single directorate except in the most looseknit fashion carvey believes that reapportionment which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries actually will increase cdc membership where only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up cdc units in rockribbed democratic territory paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register  and to in the partys favor strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis like most democratic spokesmen carvey predicts  will be a tremendously partisan year hence the attention theyre lavishing on the cdc in all probability the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these preprimary favorites this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who dont see eyetoeye with the cdc naturally the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f kennedy last year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign the cdc plainly intends to provide the partys campaign muscle in  there is evidence that it will be happily

pennsylvania gazette a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c atkinson and charles alexander who had just taken over franklins old paper desired a more distinctive name when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays in the middle of the century with a circulation of  the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in  cyrus h k curtis purchased it paper type and all for  it was a page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany and with only some  subscribers little more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the franklin tradition the saturday evening post was slow to revive but curtis poured over  million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country remember the

bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament the first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english since it was issued in the spring of  the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible however biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in  as the english revised version and in  as the american standard version then in  americas international council of religious education authorized a new revision in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages undertaken by  american scholars under the chairmanship of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university divinity school their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version  not rival the new english bible the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship time of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose bible reading even more so than good classical music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james version however an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars one is impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language than in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james for example in the third chapter of matthew verses  describing the baptism of jesus the  version reads then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him clearer meaning certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings in the new english bible which reads then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee and he came to john to be baptized by him john tried to dissuade him do you come to me he said i need rather to be baptized by you jesus replied let it be so for the present we do well to conform this way with all that god requires john then allowed him to come after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven opened he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him the paragraphing spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount to illustrate the first blessing in the king james bible reads blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven the new version states how blest are those who know that they are poor the kingdom of heaven is theirs some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar to a novice that is significant in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains however the old phrase angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop this is not contemporary english mostly contemporary for the most part however the new version is contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ originally recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated and retranslated through the ages discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy of the bible to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth there is one danger however with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic the only answer will be continuous study the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england church of scotland methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian church of england churches in wales churches in ireland society of friends british and foreign bible society and national society of

place next to the electric razor in the american bathroom the brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface including the back of the teeth in addition the motor has the seal of approval of the underwriters laboratories which means it is safe the unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in the speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor the bushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own most of us brush our teeth by hand the same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men the electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction the way dentists recommend in addition it is small enough to get into crevices jacket and crown margins malposed anteriors and the back teeth the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary bushing especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly bedfast with a chronic disease or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy but for many of us it will prove an enjoyable luxury it is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles since the apparatus is new it requires

against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future herbert a leggett bankereditor of the phoenix arizona progress reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows which gave him inferiority complexes though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent wellinformed american but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a  profit on the stock market every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bullseye achievements the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it his answer was simple but honest he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bullseye one of the obstacles to the easy control of a yearold child is a lack of verbal communication the child understands no he senses his mothers disapproval but explanations leave him confused and unmoved if his mother loves him he clings to that love as a ballast it motivates his behavior he wants mommy to think him a good boy he doesnt want her to look frowningly at him or speak to him angrily this breaks his heart he wants to be called sweet good considerate and mothers little helper but even mothers loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mothers love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them his own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed it wont develop until he has words with which to clothe it the conscience is nonexistent in the yearold what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior she can decrease the number of temptations she can remove all knickknacks within reach the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child if he cant play with mommys magazines he should have some old numbers of his own if daddys books are out of bounds his own picture books are not toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the childs conscience she tells him of the consequences of his behavior if he bites a playmate she says danny wont like you if he snatches a toy she says caroline wants her own truck just as you do there is no use trying to explain to a yearold actions speak louder remove temptations remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act he wont submit to his natural desires all the time and its mothers love that is responsible for his good behavior this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call homecoming day they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes the football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperors lions it is true of course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and then the christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team even with all possible precaution homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them more often than not as the old grad wanders along the old paths his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the aroma of autumn fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat usually they titter loudly after they have passed by his dream goes he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous his bifocals blur his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth it is not much better if he meets with old classmates too often unless he hails them they pass him by he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said on returning from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didnt even recognize him if they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace the moment soon is done after all when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie  when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live  when questions are asked and answered about families and children and old professors  when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted  that does it middleaged spread by then one begins to notice the middleage spread the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin or too heavy the fading signs of old beauty the athlete of bygone years who wears a size  suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length  then it is time to break it up and move on it is if anything worse on the old player  he sits in the stands and he doesnt like that enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd he always feels lonely a team feels something on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about him he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped the churning of straining feet the rasp of the canvas pants the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his face he remembers the desperate panting breath the long runs on the kickoffs the hard jolting tackles the breakthrough the desperate agony of goalline stands and so he squirms with each play remembering his youth but it is no use it is gone no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength they can never be recaptured again since the obvious is not always true the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred as suspected in the larger cities of  cities with populations of  and more mr kennedy carried  and mr nixon  there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election these are new york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois and minnesota in  mr eisenhower won all but missouri yet in  all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia mr nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed to do so his visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey in the summer of  was expected to win the polish vote which in several cities is substantial yet the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr nixon received but  per cent of the socalled polish vote  per cent of the irish vote and  per cent of the negro vote task force a gop task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be a statistical one and not a reality the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working parttime do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics which the gop declared it to be the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery senator mundts gross distortion of president eisenhowers conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr eisenhower declared to be entirely false is another case in point if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities errors repeated the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt goldwater bridges dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the s in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr hoover and the partys failure to anticipate or cope with the depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash the republican party was not lacking in humanity but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble farmers called their muledrawn pickup trucks hoover carts smokers reduced to the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as hoover dust one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasnt meant to repeat this error but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f kennedy that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that  per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nations business the most articulate republicans are those who in their desire to get back at mr kennedy already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care if they also defeat the school bill the gop task force wont have much research to do it will early know why the party wont win back city votes the  general assembly has important business to consider the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner after the griffinbyrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a prelegislative forum this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions hopedfor legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a selfinsurance system for the state in the midst of a governors race how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt gov garland byrds senate committee on government operations the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governors race forward a few months causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual but when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november the situation was aggravated neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation to have refused would have been political suicide and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast aside the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious candidates but state party chairman james gray of albany said no and he didnt mince any words they are just asking too much he said we cant think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates either there are other dangers politics is an accelerating game if an opponent accuses you of lying dont deny it say he is a horse thief runs an old adage these men are spenders if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where the promises would end griffins rural roads authority and byrds  miles of county contracts would look like paupers oaths the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one why not have them travel the state in november debating it would present a forum for them in almost every community but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governors race being run in the next legislature the spectre of big spending programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin there isa way out of this the chamber has not arranged a prelegislative forum it has arranged a campaign for governor if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates it can provide a service to the state but the legislature should be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing up sides for the race former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was not a great soldier ikes somewhat like george washington both won a pretty fairsized war with a modest assist from british strategy congressmen returning from recess say the people admire president kennedy so much theyre even willing to heed his call to sacrifice and give up his program slogan of the john birch society paddle your own canoe the guy who makes the motor boats may be a communist a republican survey says kennedy won the  election on the religious issue too many people were afraid if the gop won theyd have to spend all their time praying the providence journal editorial jan  entitled east greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours your suggested solution it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the welltodo could afford to buy land and build in the new sites what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs bostitch inc is approximately half way through a year exemption of their real estate tax the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory the  tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars with our current  per hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow mr richard preston executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october   warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said if this is the fundamental reason for a communitys interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain he went on to say in the first place industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life the fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called for example  the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessetteast greenwichpotowomut area of the two communities  the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich  the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent county memorial hospital a regional facility  the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment  feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich  east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves  the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny  i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund it is indeed true as stated in the famous novel of our day for whom the bell tolls that no man is an island entirely of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main thanks to the generosity of mr irving j fain president of the temple beth el rev dewitt clemens pastor of the mathewson street methodist church mr felix miranda of the imperial knife co and to mrs rozella switzer regional director of the national conference of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund it is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful and good bless you my friends for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality  i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school my future plans are to become a language teacher of course having this desire i am very interested in education a few weeks ago i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston the article also said that a person had to be  years old or over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade i wish you could see the situation as i see it if russian pupils have to take these languages how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many exceptions i do not think that america is like russia not in the least i am proud of my country the small city i live in my wonderful parents my friends and my school but i am also a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students well there lies your answer  at the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency however the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time many thanks for a job well done  the providence sunday journal article jan  asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have nonserviceconnected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of serviceconnected and nonserviceconnected disabled veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service it can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as nonservice cases later qualify as serviceconnected no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the nonserviceconnected case seem to be coldly impractical and outofstep with the wishes of the general public i believe in priority for serviceconnected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals but i dont believe we should close the door on nonserviceconnected patients this matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long theres a reason for this length of stay first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient he has no experience with this veterans previous medical record if the doctor is conscientious he wants to study the patient as a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient secondly the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any  state hospitals  it seems that open season upon veterans hospitalization is once more upon us the american medical association is once again grinding out its tearsoaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer do they the ama offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama on the health problem confronting the aged they opposed the forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars matched incidentally by a federal grant to initiate a lousy job chicago aug   no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even panic this we can sympathetically understand but no president ever before referred to his as a lousy job as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen barry goldwater during his aggressive campaign to win his present position mr kennedy was vitriolic about this countrys prestige abroad what does he think a remark like this lousy one does to our prestige and morale if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a lousy job then heaven help us all  questions shelters evansville ind aug   defense secretary robert s mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about  million dollars why should congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least  miles in diameter this sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization  short shorts on the campus chicago aug   it seems college isnt what it should be i refer to the attire worn by the students upon a visit to a local junior college last week i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years education should be uppermost in their minds but with this attire how can anyone think it is so it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students many high school students go past my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen no matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts  masaryk award chicago aug   the granting of the jan masaryk award august  to senator paul douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed masaryk and against principles masaryk died to uphold douglas has voted for aid to communists and for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid etc  subsidies from cta oak park aug   in todays voice the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should the welfare of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community not only of that part of it that rides the cta cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children policemen and firemen  marketing meat chicago aug   in reply to a letter in todays voice urging the sale of meat after  p m i wish to state the other side of the story i am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market my husbands hours away from home for the past years have been from  a m to  p m the early part of the week and as late as  or  on weekends now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings and sundays too for this is coming there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying stores where meat cutters will not be required if a customer wishes a special cut it will not be available we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week on weekends when prices are lower also many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them independent market owners work six days a week and my husband hasnt had a vacation in  years no we are not greedy but if we closed the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block the meat cutters union which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets what it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice of cut being made by the consumer not the store  the legion convention and sidney holzman chicago aug   i too congratulate the american legion of which i am proud to have been a member for more than  years on the recent state convention i regret that bertha madeira todays voice obtained incorrect information had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and without an amendment to the law we could not enforce this my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises and not by innuendo criticize them at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties  teaching the handicapped chicago aug   the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field the illinois commission for handicapped children which for  years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois and of promoting more adequate services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children  from candlelight club minneapolis aug   i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed your june  article on liberace and to thank you for it please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person  more school less pay chicago aug   is this perhaps one of the things that is wrong with our country engineering graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the schools history  a month my son who has completed two years in engineering school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer at a rate of  an hour he is now earning approximately  a month ironic is it not that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer  the dupont case editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page washington aug   your july  editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective tax relief for du pont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact as a result your criticism of attorney general robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate unwarranted and unfair the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on du pont stockholders in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that du pont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that du pont stockholders might have to pay from an estimated  billion dollars under present law to as little as  million dollars congressman wilbur d mills chairman of the house ways and means committee asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to antitrust law enforcement the attorney general responded by letter dated july  copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public in this letter mr kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration what effect the legislative proposals might have on future antitrust judgments there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress not the department of justice to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation yet your editorial said now the attorney general writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion what mr kennedy in fact wrote was it is the departments view that no antitrust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion the editorial by omitting the words antitrust enforcement totally distorted mr kennedys views the headline is offensive particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial  congresswoman church wilmette aug   i concur most heartily with todays letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen and sen douglas but when you write to congresswoman church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely should she disagree she explains why in detail when she agrees you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged i think we have the hardest working best representative in congress harmful drinks downers grove aug   a recent news story reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed  airplane passengers  minutes in london while they finished their drinks they do our country great harm by such actions those in the public eye should be good examples of american citizens while abroad the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra and martin to guzzle  toward socialism providence aug   overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nations main industries in covert socialism toward which america is moving private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them in order to attract new industries  states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise this is a step toward overt socialism issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions workers of the party to the editor sir we are writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences the day before election day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers of the party being ethical and professional people interested in community health and wellbeing we felt this wasnt a function of our position such tactics reek of totalitarianism as we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation we therefore considered the suggestion an insult to our intelligence ethics bill of rights etc our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion for the person we feel is capable in directing the public this is our duty not as nurses or city employes but as citizens of the united states  plusone shelters to the editor sir i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves but ready to demand that the community help and protect them community shelters are of course necessary for those having no space for shelter if in a town of  private homes half of them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that homes occupants plusone so he will be able to take in a stranger i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of our plusone shelter club  escape to the editor sir people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space its simple enough from my point of view i am for it it is the only method left for a man to escape from a womans world  supports katanga to the editor sir when the colonies decided upon freedom from england we insisted through the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity it is high time the united states began to realize that the godgiven rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga in the united nations charter the right of selfdetermination is also an essential principle this again applies to katanga the people of katanga had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga and his cohorts by political economic geographic and natural standards they were justified in doing so the united states and the un denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of selfdetermination of the katangans  county college costs to the editor sir permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed none will be elected the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college since two of these could be trustees of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue this is taxation without representation  taxing improvements to the editor sir your editorial housing speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers will happen our entire economy will have a terrific uplift  natural causes to the editor sir an old man is kicked to death by muggers the medical examiner states that death was due to natural causes i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york it is listed as death due to natural causes  praises exhibit to the editor sir every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit our changing skyline in newark it will be at the museum until march  it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects plans models and pictures it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit  parkway courtesy to the editor sir i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere one even gave my little dog a biscuit it was very refreshing  deep peep show the viewers of the deep peep show at th and m streets nw have an added attraction the view of a fossilized cypress swamp twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black coallike deposit has been encountered this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypresslike trees were growing the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay some of the stumps are as much as three feet long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments although the wood has been changed to coal much of it still retains its original cell structure in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time these microfossils indicate the swamp was formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing the th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on th street reported in the washington post august   which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger  working for peace recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points that i would like to question  he said lets work for peace instead of protection from aggression i would ask why not do both military power does not cause war war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people are we not late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough about this lack of understanding  as to protection the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone is this a reason for saving no one would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone  the speaker suggested that the desolation of a postattack world would be too awful to face if the world comes to this wouldnt it be the very time when courage and american knowhow would be needed to help survivors rebuild many of our young people think it would  lastly the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian defense in  public law  created civil defense different from civiliangroups of world war ii a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or manmade far from creating fear as the speaker suggests preparedness knowing what to do in an emergency gives people confidence civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster storm flood accident or even war  pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someones apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide in addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash i grant that the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments  sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists comfort perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season as an added suggestion to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument it is visible throughout the city and men from madison ave would jump at the chance   sen hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart he like most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens let us like the french have outdoor cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd  dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee may  by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work for a neutral germany  soviets said to fear resurgence of german militarism  to the editor of the new york times for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations recent statements by wellknown scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fallouts should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations president kennedy was right when he said we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate i have just returned from a sevenweek trip to europe and the far east it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war the fact is that the italians french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs we have no right to criticize them as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated probable agreement the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse actually the communists out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u n if the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival which has many facets why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world  meeting u n obligations to the editor of the new york times in your editorial of sept  the smoldering congo you make the following comment far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments it is up to the assembly to take action against them they are violating their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations article  section  the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization section  the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly article  a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years the u s s r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget but they refuse as do the arab states to support the united nations expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel and the u n troops in the congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations but by a special budget according to the official interpretation of the charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the special united nations budgets and of course cannot be expelled from the organization which you suggested in your editorial due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion  to aid international law  connally amendments repeal held step toward world order  to the editor of the new york times in your sept  editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eightyseventh congress you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this countrys domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice the connally amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from using the court effectively yet although the kennedy administration and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken our destiny in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace with justice under law to achieve this destiny acts as well as words are needed not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our selfjudging attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eightyseventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment  for better subway services to the editor of the new york times many homebound subway riders utilizing the flushingmain street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventyfourth street and change for the ind this takes a daily toll of time and temper the transit authority has recently placed in operation hold lights at bmt thirtyninth and fiftyninth street stations in brooklyn this holds the local until the express passengers change trains without question this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station  phone service criticized to the editor of the new york times as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly from three to four hours a day in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing however there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing persontoperson calls special longdistance calls etc either it is lack of training lack of proper screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company which does have a governmentblessed monopoly fairpriced funeral to the editor i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be governmentcontrolled the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price far less than i had expected to pay but the hospitals and doctors should be  helping retarded children to the editor recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children hazel park donates its recreation center five days a week to the school there is no charge and no state aid kiwanis american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support there are  children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass they make beautiful objects enough trading stamps were collected to buy a passenger station wagon southfield schools furnish an old passenger bus the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat the school is located at  mile road woodward heights visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do  jobs for cavanagh to the editor i was surprised at mayor mirianis defeat but perhaps mayorelect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare dpw and sanitation negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out educate the city employes to give real service to the public after all they are paid by the public they should be examples  church finds news features are helpful to the editor at a recent meeting of the womens association of the trumbull ave united presbyterian church considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration the daily prayer and three minutes a day as being very helpful we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines  rude youngsters to the editor thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence how old do you have to be to remember when americans especially children were encouraged to be polite why has this form of gentility gone out of american life how can we oldfashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern parents they have observed from necessity they are also inspired by the hardsell attitude of the sponsor so finally it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising  dunes park advocate to the editor i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area ghost town to the editor of the inquirer i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles we have now a quiet city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping in center city good for mr trimmer maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town  defends big trucks to the editor of the inquirer i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldnt be an expressway without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future mr george hough oct  sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop the trucks today help pay for this highway they try to keep within the speed limits although todays trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road  out of school at  to the editor of the inquirer the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at  should have signed his letter simpleton instead of simplicitude such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for the dropouts what we need is more vocational training in high schools not more dropouts  two wrongs to the editor of the inquirer i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children if an atom bomb in  could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have at least the bombs can inflict all the demage that is necessary why do we need bigger and better bombs i repeat two wrongs do not make a right  we tremble not to the editor of the inquirer everyone should take time to read martin luthers hymn a mighty fortress is our god especially the first half of the third verse   out of the race to the editor of the inquirer to our everlasting shame we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race are we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be our master and destroy us  why trust jagan to the editor of the inquirer just because cheddi jagan new boss of british guiana was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isnt a red we have quite a few homegrown specimens of our own if we go all gooey over this newest castro until he proves he isnt weve got rocks in our heads how many times must we get burned before we learn  russia and un to the editor of the inquirer just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london or pearl harbor that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world why arent the soviets expelled from the un  belated tribute to the editor of the inquirer while better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task according to one report however mr hammarskjold was considered too controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring actually of course that label controversial applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union at khrushchevs door therefore can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy  people to people to the editor of the inquirer just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a firstclass example of people to people good will if only this could be done more often with such heartening results many of the earths big problems would shrink to the insignificances they really are p s thanks for your good coverage of ahmads visit too  expressway answer east river drive to the editor of the inquirer your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice they start on the east side of the schuylkill have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination bridges tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings each one of these is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion we should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep ars starting and ending on the east side of the river on the east side this can be accomplished by several logical steps  widen the east river drive at least one lane  so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems  paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent  this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive  shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square  take away george washingtons statue  replace it with the statue of one or another of the worlds famous dictators theres no sense in being reminded of times that were washington square seems not part of a free land it may remind one of russia china or east berlin but it cant remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but its a very good start on the road to totalitarianism  the commission has posted signs in washington square saying the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square fairmount park commission does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance if birds dont belong in a square or park what does they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature the trees are their homes but the commission does not share such sentiments the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds starlings and blackbirds are scared off by cannon from city hall just a preliminary measure if any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too the city government is not united in an allout tothedeath drive to stamp out gangs delinquents thugs murderers rapists subversives indeed no let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive of course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because were afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say how come whats your motive who wants this deed done in this small way do the leaders of a city or of a nation iniure the masses to watching or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music but one let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn abide with me we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what the birds would ask   not pushups but standups to the editor of the inquirer there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too soft unfortunately those who would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft ashamed of our wealth and power afraid of socalled world opinion and addicted to peace we have allowed our softheartedness to lead to softheaded policies when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit selfdetermination when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no longer be soft america doesnt need to pushup she needs to stand up  disputes stans column business scandal views to the editor the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit however he states unequivocally the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor i must in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the socalled scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrumgriffin act escalation unto death the nuclear war is already being fought except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets not yet it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories they predicted escalation and escalation is what we are getting the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some  megatons although our bs are said to be carrying two megaton bombs apiece some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them he seems to have at least a few  and megaton bombs on hand since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock and now of course the hue and cry for counterescalation is being raised on our side khrushchev threatens us with a megaton bomb so be it then we must embark on a crash program for megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds what is needed philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun october  is a discontinuity the escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison writes the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers europe of course must be written off out of hand he feels therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing in the atmosphere on the greatest possible scale all in the name of national security escalation is their first love and their last they will be faithful unto death capable as their minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nations security are incapable of learning or even of observing if this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation he has gained only one thing he has exploded a megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges but if his purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another it is only natural thus when the russians sent up their first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly the tide turns when east germans fled to the west by the thousands paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists they are less vocal now when it is the west berliners who are migrating the flood is not as great only  a week according to one apparently conservative account but it is symptomatic west berlin morale is low and in age distribution the situation is unfavorable nearly  per cent of west berlins  residents are sixtyfive or older only  per cent are under fifteen r h s crossman mp writing in the manchester guardian states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of  but of  a week and applications to leave have risen to  a week the official statistics show that  per cent are employed workers or independent professional people whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by  arrivals each week from west germany but the hard truth says crossman is that the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow the gallant halfcity is dying on its feet another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer london mark arnoldfoster writes people are leaving west berlin because they think it is dying they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months frontline work in factories in west berlin berlins resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed the handwriting is on the wall the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort will not avail tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful the materials for compromise are at hand the nation walter lippmann and other sober commentators see alan clark on p  have spelled them out again and again a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph but it will save berlin or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence if that is what the west wants vacancy the removal of stalins body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history it is in fact a relatively mild chastisement of the dead a british writer richard haestier in a book dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry iv who had died nearly  years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob and in england after the restoration the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows contemplating these posthumous punishments stalin should not lose all hope in  parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing whitehall and there presumably he still stands nikita khrushchev however has created yet another problem for himself the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow is a crowded city and the creed of communism deplores waste who will take stalins place beside lenin there is karl marx of course buried in london the macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has been dead seventyeight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable who then is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin who but nikita himself since he has just shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people besides he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations seems to match that of life suppose he did lie beside lenin would it be permanent if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession when a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand u thant of burma the appointment of u thant of burma as the uns acting secretary general at this writing the choice appears to be certain offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running but france didnt like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr hammarskjold u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy in all the bitter infighting the squabbles over election procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries theme the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat he has moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future he is a buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung u thant of course will hold office until the spring of  when mr hammarskjolds term would have come to an end whether the compromises on both sides that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen mr khrushchevs demand for a troika is dormant not dead the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents in a sense the showdown promised by mr hammarskjolds sudden and tragic death has been avoided no precedents have been set as yet structurally the un is still fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong to the hills girls no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade these are mentalities which crave action and they are beginning to get it as messrs salsich and engh report on page  even in areas where political connotations are deliberately left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading friends a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley alabama if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast the account reads they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commandotrained telephone employees all girls  heavily armed and mobilized as a fastmoving civil defense outfit  operators and office personnel  stand ready to move into action at a minutes notice according to friends the unit was organized by john snook a former world war ii commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company the girls very fetching in their uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols rifles and other such ladies accessories this may be opera bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means the doctrine has never worked it is not working now the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms it cannot bring them into actual play a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined as the civic temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier but the guns are real soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst all false gods resemble moloch at least in the early phases of their careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idolworship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice but there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish cult of the motorcar is exceeding all bounds in its demands the annual butchery of  american men women and children to satiate its bloodlust is excessive a quota of  a year would be more than sufficient no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace if the railroads for example regularly slaughtered  passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical here then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning from next new years day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all media of communication to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meatwagon has picked up the twentyfive thousandth corpse but let the twentyfive thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the  state highway commissioners then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july   the scene of course should be nine miles northwest of centralia illinois the geographical center of population according to the census a special grandstand protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois should be erected for occupancy by honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized the band should play the rogues march as a processional switching to hail columbia happy land as the trap is sprung independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it the highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds up  americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for the better moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put true the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor even a miniscule sect and their credo homekeeping hearts are happiest is as disreputable as socinianism nonetheless although few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia robert ruarks grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this gallivantin in any event the yearly sacrifice of  victims is a hecatomb too
